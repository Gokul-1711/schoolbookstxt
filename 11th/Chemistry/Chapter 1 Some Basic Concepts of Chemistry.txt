SOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY

Chemistry is the science of molecules and their 
transformations. It is the science not so much of the one 
hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules

Balancing a chemical equation
According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of 
atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by 
trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides 
  4 Fe(s)  +  3O2(g)  → 2Fe2O3(s)  (a) balanced equation
  2 Mg(s)  +  O2(g)  → 2MgO(s)  (b) balanced equation
  P4(s)   +  O2 (g)  → P4O10(s)  (c) unbalanced equation
Equations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on 
each side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus 
atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on 
the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the 
right side of the equation.
  P4(s)  +  5O2(g)  → P4O10(s)  balanced equation          
Now, let us take combustion of propane, C3H8. This equation can be balanced in steps.
Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are 
reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.
  C3H8(g)  +  O2(g) → CO2 (g) + H2O(l)   unbalanced equation
Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms:  Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three 
CO2 molecules are required on the right side.
      C3H8 (g)  +  O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + H2O (l)
Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants 
however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be 
required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.
  C3H8  (g) +O2 (g)  → 3CO2  (g)+4H2O (l)
Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms:  There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in 
CO2 and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO2 
and 4×1= 4 in water).  Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen 
atoms.
  C3H8 (g) +5O2   (g)  →  3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)
Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The 
equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always 
remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance 
an equation.

mole fractions of A and B are given as: molarity and volume, respectively, can be used. 

In this case, M1 is equal to 0.2M; V1 = 1000 
mL and, M2 = 1.0M; V2 is to be calculated. 
Substituting the values in the formula:

0.2 M × 1000 mL = 1.0 M × V2

Note that the number of moles of solute 
(NaOH) was 0.2 in 200 mL and it has remained 
the same, i.e.,  0.2 even after dilution ( in 1000 
mL) as we have changed just the amount 
of solvent (i.e., water) and have not done 
anything with respect to NaOH. But keep in 
mind the concentration.

Summary

Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India, 
already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of 
modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life. 

The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere 
of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes 
undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states – 
solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states 
of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified 
into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type, 
which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or 
more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many 
of the substances present around us are mixtures.

When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The 
quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the 
quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English 

2024-25

Some BaSic conceptS of chemiStry 25

and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to 
have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units 
(International System of Units).

Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain 
amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities 
is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide 
range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific	
notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant	
figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express 
the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert 
the results from one system of units to another.

The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination 
— these being the law of conservation of mass, Law	of	Definite	Proportions,	Law	of	
multiple proportions, Gay lussac’s law of Gaseous volumes and avogadro law. All 
these laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks 
of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon, 
which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the 
average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different 
isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of 
the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be 
calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound 
and its molecular mass. 

The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are 
expressed in the terms of  avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the 
respective particles or entities.

Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and 
compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients 
indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular 
reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called 
stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) 
required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The 
amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, 
e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.
