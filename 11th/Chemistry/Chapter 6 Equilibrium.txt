6.1.5 General Characteristics of 
Equilibria Involving Physical 
Processes

For the physical processes discussed above, 
following characteristics are common to the 
system at equilibrium:
(i) Equilibrium is possible only in a closed 

system at a given temperature.
(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at 

the same rate and there is a dynamic 
but stable condition.

(iii) All measurable properties of the system 
remain constant.

physical process, it is characterised by Fig. 6.2  Attainment of chemical equilibrium.

Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity
Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can 
be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. 
However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity 
can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.

Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 
30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill 
nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal 
of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty. 

Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, 
close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to 
cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner 
from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass 
tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both 
the cylinders becomes constant.

If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be 
any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of 
coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say 
the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic 
nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find 
that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are 
responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product 
in it at the beginning.

Similarly let us consider the reaction, 

H2(g) + I2(g)  2HI(g). If we start with 
equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the 
reaction proceeds in the forward direction 
and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases 
while that of HI increases, until all of these 
become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We 
can also start with HI alone and make the 
reaction to proceed in the reverse direction; 
the concentration of HI will decrease and 
concentration of H2 and I2 will increase until 
they all become constant when equilibrium is 
reached (Fig. 6.5).  If total number of H and I 
atoms are same in a given volume, the same 
equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we

(H2, N2, NH3 and D2, N2, ND3) are mixed 
together and left for a while.  Later, when 
this mixture is analysed, it is found that the 
concentration of ammonia is just the same 
as before. However, when this mixture is 
analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found 
that ammonia and all deuterium containing 
forms of ammonia (NH3, NH2D, NHD2 and 
ND3) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms 
(H2, HD and D2) are present. Thus one can 
conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in 
the molecules must result from a continuation 
of the forward and reverse reactions in the 
mixture. If the reaction had simply stopped Fig. 6.5  Chemical equilibrium in the reaction H2(g)

EQUILIBRIUM 207

SUmmArY

When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules 
returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in 
nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at 
this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, Kc is 
expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the 
stoichiometric coefficient.

For reaction, a A + b B        c C +d D
Kc = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b

Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the 
macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous 
reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing concentration 
terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by 
reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. le Chatelier’s principle states that 
the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the 
equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. 
It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, 
pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of 
products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition 
of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new 
lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.

All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, 
bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions 
is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes 
in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes 
there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to 
Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous 
solutions. brönsted-lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as 
a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate 
base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate 
pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. lewis further generalised the definition of an 
acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions 
for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (Ka) and weak bases (Kb) are developed 
using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and 
common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration 
(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka]; 
pKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we 
note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and 
weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in 
aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions,  and their importance are discussed 
briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium 
constant is introduced as solubility product constant (Ksp). Its relationship with solubility 
of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions 
or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of 
sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.
