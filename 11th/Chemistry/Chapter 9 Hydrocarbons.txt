Hydrocarbons are the important sources of energy.

hydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic 
compounds. You can construct a large 
number of models of such molecules of both 
types (open chain and close chain) keeping 
in mind that carbon is tetravalent and 
hydrogen is monovalent. For making models 
of alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds 
and plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes, 
alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring 
models can be constructed. Fig. 9.1  Structure of methane

colour of bromine solution in carbon 
tetrachloride is discharged when bromine 
adds up to an unsaturation site. This 
reaction is used as a test for unsaturation. 
Addition of halogens to alkenes is an 
example of electrophilic addition reaction 
involving cyclic halonium ion formation (9.42)
which you will study in higher classes. Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a 

generalisation in 1869 after studying such 
reactions in detail. These generalisations 
led Markovnikov to frame a rule called 
Markovnikov rule. The rule states that 
negative part of the addendum (adding 

(9.38) molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom 
which possesses lesser number of hydrogen 
atoms. Thus according to this rule, product 
I i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual 
practice, this is the principal product of the 

 reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov 
(9.39) rule can be better understood in terms of 

mechanism of the reaction.

Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in 
Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He 
made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that 
carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found 
an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that 
these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural  formula to 
benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described 
the discovery of benzene structure later as:

background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this 1896)
kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold  conformations; long 
rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What 
was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my 
eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of 
the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us 
beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).
 One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds 
having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes. 

was further found to produce one and only one 
monosubstituted derivative which indicated 
that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms 
of benzene are identical. On the basis of this 
observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed 
the following structure for benzene having 
cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with

plane of the ring as shown below:

 
 However, benzene was found to form only 
one ortho disubstituted product. This problem 
was overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the 
concept of oscillating nature of double bonds 
in benzene as given below.

could later on be explained by resonance.

Resonance and stability of benzene
According to Valence Bond Theory, the 
concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene 
is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a 
hybrid of various resonating structures. The 
two structures, A and B given by Kekulé  are 
the main contributing structures. The hybrid 
structure is represented by inserting a circle 
or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown 
in (C). The circle represents the six electrons 
which are delocalised between the six carbon Fig. 9.7 (a)
atoms of the benzene ring.

   (A)     (B)                               (C)
 The orbital overlapping gives us better 
picture about the structure of benzene. All 
the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 
hybridized. Two sp2 hybrid orbitals of each 
carbon atom overlap with sp2 hybrid orbitals 
of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C—C 
sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal 
plane. The remaining sp2 hybrid orbital of Fig. 9.7 (b)

each carbon atom overlaps with s orbital  Structures shown in Fig. 9.7(a) and (b) 
of a hydrogen atom to form six C—H sigma correspond to two Kekulé’s structure with 
bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one localised π bonds. The internuclear distance

 Fig. 9.7 (c)                    Fig. 9.7 (d)

 The six π electrons are thus delocalised 
and can move freely about the six carbon 
nuclei, instead of any two as shown in 
Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud 
is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the 
carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised 
between two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence 
of delocalised π electrons in benzene makes 
it more stable than the hypothetical 
cyclohexatriene.

fused together are toxic and said to 
possess cancer producing (carcinogenic) 
property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons 
are formed on incomplete combustion of 
organic materials like tobacco, coal and 
petroleum. They enter into human body 
and undergo various biochemical reactions 
and finally damage DNA and cause cancer. 
Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are 
given below (see box).

Meta directing group: The groups which 
direct the incoming group to meta position are 
called meta directing groups. Some examples 
of meta directing groups are –NO2, –CN, –CHO, 
–COR, –COOH, –COOR, –SO3H, etc. 
 Let us take the example of nitro group. 
Nitro group reduces the electron density in 
the benzene ring due to its strong–I effect. 
Nitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the 
following structures.

Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly 
obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals 
are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of 
commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and  CNG (compressed 
natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are 
obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes) 
and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their 
structure. 

The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation 
and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly 
electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo 
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under 
special conditions. 

Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma 
bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation 
is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical 
(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond. 

benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the 
property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure 
characterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached 
to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards 
further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of 
the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.
