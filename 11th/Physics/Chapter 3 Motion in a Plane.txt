3.2  SCALARS AND VECTORS

In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or
vectors.  Basically, the difference is that a direction is
associated with a vector but not with a scalar.  A scalar
quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified
completely by a single number, along with the proper
unit. Examples are : the distance between two points,
mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the
time at which a certain event happened.  The rules for
combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra.
Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided

2.7 kg, then its volume is 10–3 m3 (a scalar)
and its density is 2.7×103 kg m–3 (a scalar).

* Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply
and divide scalars of different units.

** In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector
unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of
application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.

The  factor λ by  which  a vector A is multiplied
could be a scalar having its own physical
dimension. Then, the dimension of λ A is the
product of the dimensions of λ and A. For
example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector
by duration (of time), we get a displacement
vector.

MOTION IN A PLANE 43

SUMMARY

1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only.  Examples are distance, speed,
mass and  temperature.

2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both.  Examples are
displacement, velocity and  acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.

3. A vector A multiplied by a real number λ  is also a vector, whose magnitude is λ times
the magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending
upon whether λ is positive or negative.

4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram
method.

5. Vector addition is commutative :
A + B = B + A

It also obeys the associative law :
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude.  Since the magnitude is zero, we
don’t have to specify its direction.  It has the properties :

A + 0 = A
     λ0 = 0
   0 A = 0

7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B :
A – B = A+ (–B)

8. A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the
same plane :

A = λ a + µ b

where λ and µ  are real numbers.
9. A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:

n̂ = A
A

The unit vectors  ɵi,  ɵj,  kɵ  are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of

the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.
10. A vector A can be expressed as

A = A iɵ + ɵ
x Ay j

where A , A  are its components along x-, and y -axes.  If vector A makes an angle θ
x y

A
with the x-axis, then A = 2 2 y

 = A cos θ, A =A sin θ and  A A = Ax + Ay ,  tanθ = .
x y Ax

11. Vectors can be conveniently added using analytical method.  If sum of two vectors A
and B, that lie in x-y plane, is R, then :

R = R iɵ ɵ
x + Ry j, where,  R  = A + B , and     R  = A  + B

x x x y y y

12. The position vector of an object in x-y plane is given by r = x iɵ + y ɵj  and the
displacement from position r to position r’ is given by

∆r = r′− r

= (x ′ − x ) iɵ + (y′ − y) ɵj

=  ∆x iɵ + ∆y ɵj
13. If an object undergoes a displacement ∆r in time ∆t, its average velocity is given by

∆r
v = . The velocity of an object at time t is the limiting value of the average velocity

∆t
as ∆t tends to zero :

When position of an object is plotted on a coordinate system, v  is  always tangent to
the curve representing the path of the object.

14. If the velocity of an object changes from v to v′in time ∆t, then its average acceleration
v − v' ∆v

is given by:  a = =

Motion in a plane can be treated as superposition of two separate simultaneous one-
dimensional motions along two perpendicular directions

16. An object that is in flight after being projected is called a projectile.  If an object is
projected with initial velocity v  making an angle θ  with x-axis and if we assume its

o o

initial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position
and velocity of the projectile at time t are given by :

x = (v  cos θ ) t
o o

                  y = (v sin θ ) t − (1/2) g t2

v  = v  = v  cos θ
x ox o o

v  = v  sin θ  − g t

       The path of a projectile is parabolic and is given by :

The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position to the position
it passes y = 0 during its fall is called the range, R of the projectile.  It is :

17. When an object follows a circular path at constant speed, the motion of the object is
called uniform circular motion. The magnitude of its acceleration is   a  = v2 /R. The

c

direction of a  is always towards the centre of the circle.
c

The angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity
v by   v = ω R.  The acceleration is a  = ω 2R.

c

If T is the time period of revolution of the object in circular motion and ν is its
frequency, we have ω = 2π ν, v = 2πνR,  a  = 4π2ν2R

POINTS TO PONDER

1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as
the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the
path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are
equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all
other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.

2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the
path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.

3. The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,
you can always resolve them along any two independent axes.

4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform
circular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its
direction is changing.

5. An object subjected to two velocities v  and v  has a resultant velocity v = v  + v . Take
1 2 1 2

care to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v = v  − v .
12 1 2

Here v  and v  are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.

6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if
the speed is constant.

7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration
alone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial
velocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration
due to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.
