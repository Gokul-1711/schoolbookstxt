Summary applying a force against the direction of its motion.

Points to ponder In these examples, the external agency of force (hands,

Exercises wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not
always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building
accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the
earth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.
This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and
magnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a
distance.

In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in
motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is
needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may
not be in contact with the body.

So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.
a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal
ice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in
uniform motion?

uniform linear motion (motion with constant line unless compelled by some external
velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is force to act otherwise.

Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science

Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of
motion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force
of wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent
tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;
transmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps
comes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to
be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air
resistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational
and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent
particles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational
and vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a
definite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of
motion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be
indicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept
of ‘instantaneous motion’ (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous
velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly
understood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results
from the transmission of vibrations of water particles.

SUMMARY

1. Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong.  A
force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.

2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and
arrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased
thus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,
unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law
is “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.

3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :
p  =  m v

4. Newton’s second law of motion :
The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes
place in the direction in which the force acts.  Thus

dp
F = k = k m a

dt
where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant
of proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then

dp
F = = ma

dt
The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.
(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)
(b) It is a vector equation
(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F

is the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as
a whole.

(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.
That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the
history of motion.

4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.
The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a
measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,
one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during
the action of the impulsive force.

6. Newton’s third law of motion:
To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction

2024-25



LAWS OF MOTION 67

In simple terms, the law can be stated thus :
Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body
B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.
Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect
relation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be
called action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different
bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction
forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.

7. Law of Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law
follows from the second and third law of motion.

8. Friction
Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two
surfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common
tangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction f  opposes impending relative

motion; kinetic friction f  opposes actual relative motion. They are independent

POINTS TO PONDER

1. Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F
may be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with
v.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.

2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that
force or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a
ball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues
to be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.

3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of
the body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of
motion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is
no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding
air are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.

4. In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all
material agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should
not be regarded as yet another force, besides F.

5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is
simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a
body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like
tension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force
in any circular motion.

6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit µ  N (f ≤ µ  N).  Do not put
s s s

f = µ N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming
s s  

into play.
7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in

equilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an
accelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third
law.

8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for
simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in
ordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction
act on different bodies.

9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,
‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’
in different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms
encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.

10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between
inanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also
requires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external
force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.

11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the
subjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’.  On a merry-go-around, all parts of
our body are subject to an  inward force,  but we have a feeling of being pushed
outward – the direction of impending motion.
