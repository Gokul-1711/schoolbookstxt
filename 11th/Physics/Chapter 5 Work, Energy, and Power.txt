5.1.1 The Scalar Product

We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 3.
Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are
added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are
multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which
we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product
gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the
vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We
shall look at the vector product in Chapter 6. Here we take
up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or
dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A.B (read

where θ  is the angle between the two vectors as

5.9  THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING

The spring force is an example of a variable force
which is conservative. Fig. 5.7 shows a block
attached to a spring and resting on a smooth
horizontal surface.  The other end of the spring
is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light
and may be treated as massless.  In an ideal
spring, the spring force F   is proportional to

s

x where x  is the displacement of the block from
the equilibrium position. The displacement could
be either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative
[Fig. 5.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called
Hooke’s law and is mathematically stated as

F  =  − kx
s

The constant k is called the spring constant.  Its
unit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k is
large and soft if k is small.

Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in attached to the free end of the spring.

SUMMARY

1. The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work
done by the net force on the body.

K  - K  = W
f i net

2. A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and
depends only on the end points {x , x }, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an

i j

arbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.
3. For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a potential energy function V(x)

such that

F ( ) dV (x )
x = −

dx

x f

or Vi − V f = ∫ F (x ) dx
x i

4. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical
energy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.

5. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth’s
surface is

V(x) = m g x
where the variation of g with height is ignored.

5. The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant k  and extension x is

V ( ) 1
x  =  k x 2

7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as A.B  and is a scalar

quantity given by :A.B = AB cos θ,  where θ  is the angle between A and B.  It can be
positive, negative or zero depending upon the value of θ. The scalar product of two
vectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component
of the other vector along the first vector. For unit vectors :

ˆi ⋅ ˆi = ˆj ⋅ ˆj = kˆ ⋅ kˆ = 1  and ˆi ⋅ ˆj = ˆj ⋅ kˆ = kˆ ⋅ ˆi = 0
Scalar products obey the commutative and  the distributive laws.

2024-25



WORK, ENERGY AND POWER 87

POINTS TO PONDER

1. The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. We should refer (or imply
clearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a
given  body over a certain displacement.

2. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and
kinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction
or viscous force on a moving body is negative.

3. For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from
Newton’s Third Law,

F +  F  =  0
12  21 

But the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.

W + W ≠  0
12  21  

However, it may sometimes be true.
4. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of

the force is not known. This is clear from Example 5.2 where the WE theorem is
used in such a situation.

5. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem
may be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation
of mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for
conservative forces.

5. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-
inertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the
net force acting on the body under consideration.

7. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always
undetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential
energy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mgh,
the zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring
potential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position
of the oscillating mass.

8. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential
energy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no
potential energy can be associated with friction.

9. During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of
the collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)
applies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.
In fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may be momentarily at rest
with respect to each other.

5.3 Given in Fig. 5.11 are examples of some
potential energy functions in one
dimension. The total energy of the
particle is indicated by a cross on the
ordinate axis. In each case, specify the

cannot be found for the given energy.
Also, indicate the minimum total

case. Think of simple physical contexts
