material objects to be attracted towards the earth.  Anything

Exercises recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy

about 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all
celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved
around the earth.  The only motion that was thought to be
possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle.
Complicated schemes of motion  were put forward by Ptolemy
in order to describe the observed motion of the planets.  The
planets were described as moving in circles with the centre
of the circles themselves moving in larger circles.  Similar
theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some
400 years later.  However a more elegant model in which the
Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved – the
‘heliocentric’ model – was already mentioned by Aryabhatta
(5th century A.D.) in his treatise. A thousand years later, a
Polish monk named Nicolas Copernicus (1473-1543)

SUMMARY

1. Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between
any two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r has the magnitude

m m
F = 1 2

G
2

r
where G is the universal gravitational constant, which has the value  6.672 ×10–11 N m2 kg–2.

2. If we have to find the resultant gravitational force acting on the particle m due to a number of
masses M1, M2, ….Mn etc. we use the principle of superposition. Let F1, F2, ….Fn be the individual
forces due to M1, M2, ….Mn, each given by the law of gravitation. From the principle of superposition
each force acts independently  and uninfluenced by the other bodies. The resultant force FR is
then found by vector addition

n

FR  =  F1 + F2 + ……+ Fn   =  ∑F
i

i =1

where the symbol ‘Σ’ stands for summation.
3. Kepler’s laws of planetary motion state that

(a) All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points
(b) The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time

intervals. This follows from the fact that the force of gravitation on the planet is central
and hence angular momentum is conserved.

(c) The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the   semi-major
axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet

The period T and radius R of the circular orbit of a planet about the Sun are related
by

where Ms is the mass of the Sun. Most planets have nearly circular orbits about the Sun. For

 5. The gravitational force is a conservative force, and therefore a potential energy function can be
defined. The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance
r is given by

G m1 mV 2
 = − 

r
where V is taken to be zero at r → ∞. The total potential energy for a system of particles is the
sum of energies for all pairs of particles, with each pair represented by a term of the form given
by above equation. This prescription follows from the principle of superposition.

6. If an isolated system consists of a particle of mass m moving with a speed v in the vicinity of a
massive body of mass M, the total mechanical energy of the particle is given by

1 2 G M m
E =  m v − 

2 r
That is, the total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. The total
energy is a constant of motion.

7. If m moves in a circular orbit of radius a about M, where M >> m, the total energy of the system is

G M m
E = − 

2a
with the choice of the arbitrary constant in the potential energy given in the point 5., above.
The total energy is negative for any bound system, that is, one in which the orbit is closed, such
as an elliptical orbit. The kinetic and potential energies are

and has a value of 11.2 km s–1.
9. If a particle is outside a uniform spherical shell or solid sphere with a spherically symmetric

internal mass distribution, the sphere attracts the particle as though the mass of the sphere or
shell were concentrated at the centre of the sphere.

10. If a particle is inside a uniform spherical shell, the gravitational force on the particle is zero. If a
particle is inside a homogeneous solid sphere, the force on the particle acts toward the centre of the
sphere. This force is exerted by the spherical mass interior to the particle.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. In considering motion of an object under the gravitational influence of another object
the following quantities are conserved:
(a)  Angular momentum
(b)  Total mechanical energy
Linear momentum is not conserved

2. Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler’s second law. However, it is not special
to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.

3. In Kepler’s third law (see Eq. (7.1) and  T2 = KS R
3. The constant KS is the same for all

planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (7.38)].
4. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the

gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut
and the satellite are in “free fall” towards the Earth.

5. The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance
r is given by

G m m
V = – 1 2 + constant

r
The constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With
this choice

G m m
V = – 1 2

r
This choice implies that V →  0 as r →  ∞.  Choosing location of zero of the gravitational
energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that
the gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.

6. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always
positive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential
energy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is
negative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.

7. The commonly encountered expression m g h for the potential energy is actually an
approximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the
point 6, above.

8. Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two
finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a
spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if
the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.

9. The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However, (unlike a
metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside
it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not
possible.

EXERCISES
7.1 Answer the following :

(a) You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor.
Can you shield a body from the gravitational influence of nearby matter by putting
it inside a hollow sphere or by some other means ?

(b) An astronaut inside a small space ship orbiting around the earth cannot detect
gravity. If the space station orbiting around the earth has a large size, can he hope
to detect gravity ?

(c) If you compare the gravitational force on the earth due to the sun to that due
to the moon, you would find that the Sun’s pull is greater than the moon’s pull.
(you can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises).
However, the tidal effect of the moon’s pull is greater than the tidal effect of sun.

(d) The formula –G Mm(1/r2  – 1/r1)  is more/less accurate than the formula
