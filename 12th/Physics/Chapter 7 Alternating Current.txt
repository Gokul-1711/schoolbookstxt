ALTERNATING
CURRENT

7.1  INTRODUCTION

We have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc
sources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages
and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains
supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function
with time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and
the current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac
current)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.
This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power
companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main
reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages
can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by
means of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted
economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which
are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we
tune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special
property of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.

* The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,
respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating
current current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity
displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted
that we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly
used means potential difference between two points.

7.2  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A RESISTOR

Figure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε of
ac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuit
diagram is . We consider a source which produces
sinusoidally varying potential difference across its
terminals. Let this potential difference, also called ac
voltage, be given by

that there is no dissipation of electrical energy. As you

Equation (7.9) gives the relation between ac current and ac voltage

introducing the concept of rms values. In terms of rms values, the equation
for power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits
are essentially the same as those for the dc case.
It is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. For
example, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak
voltage of

v  =

In fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would
produce the same average power loss as the alternating current. Equation
(7.7) can also be written as

P = V2 / R = I V    (since V = I R )

7.3 REPRESENTATION OF AC CURRENT AND VOLTAGE

BY ROTATING VECTORS — PHASORS

In the previous section, we learnt that the current through  a resistor is
in phase with the ac voltage. But this is not so in the case  of an inductor,
a capacitor or a combination  of these circuit elements. In order to show
phase relationship between voltage and current
in an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the
use of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector
which rotates about the origin with angular
speed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical
components of phasors V and I represent the
sinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The
magnitudes of phasors V and I represent  the
amplitudes or the peak values v  and i  of these

m m
oscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the FIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the
voltage and current phasors and their circuit in Fig 7.1. (b) Graph of v and

connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of
voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., v  sinw t and i  sinw t,

m m
respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As
they rotate with frequency w, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.
From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are
in the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase
angle between the voltage and the current is zero.

7.4  AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO AN INDUCTOR

Figure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually,
inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall
assume that this inductor has negligible resistance.
Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let
the voltage across the source be v = v  sinw t. Using

m

the Kirchhoff’s loop rule, ∑ ε (t ) = 0 , and  since there

is no resistor in the circuit,

* Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating
vectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens
that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine
mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of
corresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a
simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know. 181

Combining Eqs. (7.1) and (7.10), we have

di v v
= = m sin ω t (7.11)

dt L L
Equation (7.11) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a

function of time, must be such that its slope di/dt is a sinusoidally varying
quantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude
given by v /L. To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to

m
time:

di v
∫ dt = m ∫ sin(ωt )dt

dt L
and get,

v
i = − m cos(ωt ) + constant

ωL
The integration constant has the dimension of current and is time-

independent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically
about zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about
zero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current
exists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.

The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance
and its SI unit is ohm (W). The inductive reactance limits the current in a
purely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the
current in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly
proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.

A comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the
current in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by p/2 or
one-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current

connected to a capacitor only, a purely capacitive ac circuit.
When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source

in a dc circuit, current will flow for the short time
required to charge the capacitor. As charge
accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage
across them increases, opposing the current. That is,
a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the
current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully
charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.

When the capacitor is connected to an ac source,
as in Fig. 7.7, it limits or regulates the current, but

FIGURE 7.7  An ac source does not completely prevent the flow of charge. The

Alternating Current

The dimension of capacitive reactance is the
same as that of resistance and its SI unit is
ohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits the
amplitude of the current in a purely capacitive
circuit in the same way as the resistance limits
the current in a purely resistive circuit. But it
is inversely proportional to the frequency and
the capacitance.

A comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the
FIGURE  7.8 (a) A Phasor diagram for the circuit

the current is π/2 ahead of voltage.
Figure 7.8(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t . Here the current

phasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate
counterclockwise. Figure 7.8(b) shows the variation of voltage and current
with time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than
the voltage by one-fourth of a period.

since <sin (2ωt)> = 0 over a complete cycle.
Thus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage
by π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.

Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict
your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each
case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?
Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor
gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and
the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.
With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ωC )
and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.
Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly
than before.

This current oscillates between +1.47A and –1.47 A, and is ahead of
the voltage by p/2.

If the frequency is doubled, the capacitive reactance is halved and
consequently, the current is doubled.

Example 7.5 A light bulb and an open coil inductor are connected to
an ac source through a key as shown in Fig. 7.9.

The switch is closed and after sometime, an iron rod is inserted into
the interior of the inductor. The glow of the light bulb (a) increases; (b)
decreases; (c) is unchanged, as the iron rod is inserted. Give your
answer with reasons.

Solution  As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil
magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,
the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive
reactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the
applied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage
across the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.

7.6.1  Phasor-diagram solution
From the circuit shown in Fig. 7.10, we see that the resistor, inductor
and capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is
the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be

i = i  sin(wt+f ) (7.21)
m

where f is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and
the current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous
sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.

Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by
Eq. (7.21). Further, let V , V , V , and V represent the voltage across the

L R C
inductor, resistor, capacitor and the source, respectively. From previous
section, we know that V  is parallel to I, V  is p/2

R C

are shown in Fig. 7.11(a) with apppropriate phase-

Consequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. If

Consequently, the current in the circuit lags  the source voltage.

Thus, we have obtained the amplitude

and phase of current for an LCR series circuit
using the technique of phasors. But this
method of analysing ac circuits suffers from
certain disadvantages. First, the phasor

condition. One can take any arbitrary value
of t (say, t , as done throughout this chapter)

and draw different phasors which show the
relative angle between different phasors.
The solution so obtained is called the
steady-state solution. This is not a general

C L v = 0. The general solution is the sum of the

transient solution and the steady-state

die out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-state
solution.

7.6.2  Resonance

An interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenon
of resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems
that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency
is called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an
energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the
amplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this
phenomenon is a child on a swing. The swing has a natural frequency

188
for swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the

2024-25



Alternating Current

rope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the
same as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will be
large (Chapter 13, Class XI).

For an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude v  and frequency
m

w, we found that the current amplitude is given by

with X  = 1/wC and X  = w L . So if w is varied, then at a particular frequency

Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in the

tuning  mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio accepts
signals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the
antenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit
can be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio
station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a
capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the
circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received.
When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of
the signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.

It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a
circuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the
voltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)
and the current amplitude is v /R, the total source voltage appearing

across R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or
RC circuit. 189

Example 7.6 A resistor of 200 W and a capacitor of 15.0 mF are
connected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source. (a) Calculate the
current in the circuit; (b) Calculate the voltage (rms) across the
resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages
more than the source voltage? If yes, resolve the paradox.

Solution

Given

R = 200Ω, C = 15.0µF = 15.0 ×10−6 F

V = 220 V, ν = 50Hz

(a) In order to calculate the current, we need the impedance of
the circuit. It is

Z = R2 + X 2 2
C = R + (2π νC)−2

   = (200Ω)2 + (2 × 3.14 × 50 ×15.0 ×10−6 )−2
F

   = (200Ω)2 + (212.3Ω)2

   = 291.67 Ω
Therefore, the current in the circuit is

V
I = = 220V = 0.755 A

Z 291.5 Ω
(b) Since the current is the same throughout the circuit, we have

VR = I R = (0.755 A)(200 Ω) = 151V

VC = I XC = (0.755 A)(212.3 Ω) = 160.3 V

The algebraic sum of the two voltages, V  and V  is 311.3 V which
R C

is more than the source voltage of 220 V. How to resolve this
paradox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not
in the same phase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary
numbers. The two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees.
Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using the
Pythagorean theorem:

V 2 2
R+C = VR + VC

= 220 V
Thus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken
into account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor
is equal to the voltage of the source.

 EXAMPLE 7.6



Alternating Current

p = v i = (vm sinω t ) × [im sin(ω t + φ)]
v

= mim [cosφ − cos(2ω t + φ)] (7.29)
2

The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in
R.H.S. of Eq. (7.29). It is only the second term which is time-dependent.
Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative
half). Therefore,

P = m cosφ = m m cosφ
2 2 2

This can also be written as,

P = I 2 Z cosφ [7.30(b)]

So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and
current but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The
quantity cosφ is called the power factor. Let us discuss the following
cases:

Case (i) Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called
resistive. In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There is maximum power dissipation.

Case (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains
only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between
voltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated
even though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes
referred to as wattless current.

Case (iii) LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is
given by Eq. (7.30) where φ = tan–1 (Xc – X

 L )/ R. So,  φ may be non-zero  in
 

a RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in
the resistor.

Case (iv) Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit: At resonance
Xc – XL= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cosφ = 1 and P = I 2Z = I2 R. That is,
maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.

Example 7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a
low power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.

(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of
appropriate capacitance in the circuit. Explain.

Solution (a) We know that P = I V cosφ where cosφ is the power factor.
To supply a given power at a given voltage, if cosφ is small, we have to
increase current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss
(I2R) in transmission.

(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then
power factor cosφ =R/Z.

We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to
R. Let us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.15) 191

how this can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. I

component since corresponding to this component of current, there
is no power loss. I   is known as the power component because it is

It’s clear from this analysis that if we want to improve power factor,
we must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current I  by an

Example 7.10 At an airport, a person is made to walk through the
doorway of a metal detector, for security reasons. If she/he is carrying
anything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what
principle does this detector work?

Solution  The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in
ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,
in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to
a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When
you walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the
circuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the
circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry
causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm. 193

7.8  TRANSFORMERS

For many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating
voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with
a device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.

A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.
They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in
Fig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the
coils called the primary coil has N  turns. The other coil is called the

p

secondary coil; it has N  turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil
s

and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.

FIGURE 7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:
(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.

When an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting
current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary
and induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of
turns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the
primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both
primary and secondary windings. Let f be the flux in each turn in the core
at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage v  is applied to it.

p
Then the induced emf or voltage e , in the secondary with N  turns is

s s

ε = − dφ
s Ns (7.31)

dt
The alternating flux f also induces an emf, called back emf in the

primary. This is

ε = dφ
p −N p (7.32)

dt
But e  = v . If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite

p p
since the  primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary is
an open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good
approximation

194
e  = v

s s

2024-25



Alternating Current

where  v  is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.31) and
s

(7.32) can be written as

dφ
vs = −Ns [7.31(a)]

d t

dφ
vp = −N p [7.32(a)]

d t
From Eqs. [7.31 (a)] and [7.32 (a)], we have

vs N
= s

vp N (7.33)
p

Note that the above relation has been obtained using three
assumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the
same flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux
escapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.

If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),
the power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,

i v  = i v (7.34)
p p s s

Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,
since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than
95%. Combining Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), we have

ip vs N
= = s

is vp N (7.35)
p

Since i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,
Eq. (7.35) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of
corresponding quantities.

Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.
We have:

 N   N
= s p 

Vs   Vp    and  Is = I
 N p    p (7.36)

N s

That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the
primary (N  > N ), the voltage is stepped up (V  > V ). This type of

s p s p
arrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,
there is less current in the secondary than in the primary (N /N  < 1 and I

p s s
< I ). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and

p
the secondary has 200 turns,  N /N  = 2 and N /N =1/2. Thus, a 220V

s p p s
input at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.

If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary (N  < N ),
s p

we have a step-down transformer. In this case, V  < V  and I  > I . That
s p s p

is, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current
is increased.

The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without
any energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do
occur due to the following reasons:
(i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of

the flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor 195

2024-25



Physics
design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by
winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.

(ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some
resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire
(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by
using thick wire.

(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents
in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a
laminated core.

(iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by
the alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in
the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic
material which has a low hysteresis loss.
The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over

long distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output
of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and
consequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long
distances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage
is stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations
and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.

SUMMARY

1. An alternating voltage v = v sin ω t  applied to a resistor R drives a
m

v
current i = i  sinwt in the resistor, i = m

m . The current is in phase with
m R

the applied voltage.

2. For an alternating current i = i  sin wt passing through a resistor R, the
m

average power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is
( 1/2 )i2 R. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I 2R), a

m
special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)
current and is donoted by I:

i
I = m = 0.707 im

2
Similarly, the rms voltage is defined by

v
V = m = 0.707vm

2
We have P = IV = I2R

3. An ac voltage v = v  sin wt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current
m

in the inductor i = i  sin (wt – p/2), where i  = v /X . X  = wL is called
m m m L L

inductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by
p/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle
is zero.

The average power loss over a complete cycle is given by

P = V I cosf

The term cosf is called the power factor.

6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosf = 0 and no power is
dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,
current is referred to as a wattless current.

7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit
can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by
rotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates
about the origin with angular speed w. The magnitude of a phasor
represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or
current) represented by the phasor.

The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor
diagram.

8. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primary
coil of N  turns and a secondary coil of N  turns. If the primary coil is

p s
connected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages are
related by

 N 
V = s

s   Vp
 N p 

and the currents are related by

 Np 
Is =  I

  p

s

If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the
voltage is stepped-up (V  > V ). This type of arrangement is called a step-

s p
up transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we
have a step-down transformer.

POINTS TO PONDER

1. When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms
value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is
normally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude
of this voltage is

vm = 2V = 2(240) = 340V

2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average
power rating.

3. The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.

4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.
But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be
derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac

198 currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction

2024-25



Alternating Current

with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to
zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property
that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating
is such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of
alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same
average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce
under the same conditions.

5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one
should take care of their phases properly. For example, if V  and V

R C

are voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the

total voltage across RC combination is V = V 2 + V 2  and not
RC R C

V  + V  since V  is p/2 out of phase of V .
R C C R

6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by
vectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are
scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of
harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same
way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding
magnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide
us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that
we already know as the law of vector addition.

7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure
inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy
in an ac circuit is the resistive element.

8. In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when X  = X  or
L C

ω 1
0 = . For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C

LC
elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C )
elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,
no resonance is possible.

9. The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the
circuit is to expending the maximum power.

10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are
reversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical
energy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the
input and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply
transform energy from one form to another.

11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.
This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The
current is reduced by the same proportion.
