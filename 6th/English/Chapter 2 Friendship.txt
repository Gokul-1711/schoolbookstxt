Gajaraj, the elephant, lived in the best booth of 
the royal stables. The king was fond of Gajaraj, 
and he had ordered that the elephant should 
be well looked after.
In spite of royal comforts, Gajaraj was sad 
because he had no friends. The mahout, or 
elephant trainer, was the only one he ever 
interacted with. The mahout was a kind man 
who served Gajaraj food, and gave him a bath 
in the elephant pond daily. He was a good 
caretaker, but not a friend.
“I wish I had a friend I can play with,” 
thought Gajaraj. One late evening, a dog 
strayed into the stable. Gajaraj could see that 
the visitor was tired and hungry. He pushed

some of the food he was munching towards 
the dog. The visitor wagged his tail, looked up 
at the elephant to convey his thanks, and then 
turned his full attention to the food in front 
of him. As soon as he finished eating, he fell 
asleep.
The next morning, the mahout found the 
stray dog in the stable. He did not mind the dog. 
He also noticed that Gajaraj seemed to like the 
company. So, he threw some crumbs to the dog, 
which the animal accepted wagging his tail.
When the elephant went out for a bath, 
the dog accompanied his friend. Plunging into 
the water, the elephant gave himself a shower 
using his long trunk, as the dog watched. 
The elephant took a trunkful of water and 
playfully splashed the water on his friend. The 
dog yelped for he hated taking showers. The 
mahout laughed.

On their way home, the elephant picked up 
the dog with his trunk and placed him on his 
back. The dog was delighted to get a ride.
A farmer passing by saw the dog. “Buntee,” 
he yelled. The dog ran to him. The farmer 
hugged the dog and told the mahout that he was 
looking for his dog ever since he disappeared 
from his house. He was glad he found him now. 
The mahout had no objection to the farmer 
taking the dog home. The farmer tossed a 
rope round the neck of the dog, saying, “Come 
Buntee, let’s go home.”

Only when the farmer pulled the rope did the 
dog realise that he was being taken away from 
his friend. He yelped, the elephant winced, but 
neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that 
the two friends were in tears.
The next day at lunch time the mahout 
served Gajaraj his favourite food. When the 
mahout came back after finishing his other 
chores, he was surprised to see that the food 
had remained untouched.

“Why Gajaraj, aren’t you hungry?” he asked 
concerned. The elephant did not react. “He 
may have slight indigestion. Let me not force 
him to eat,” thought the mahout.
That night too, Gajaraj did not touch his 
food—nor the next day. Now, the mahout was 
worried. He ran his hand on Gajaraj’s tummy 
and felt there was nothing wrong. “Why was 
he not eating then? Is he missing his friend, 
that dog?” the mahout wondered.
Meanwhile at the farmer’s house, the dog 
had also not touched his food ever since he 
was brought home.
“Are you missing your friend?” asked the 
farmer remembering the happy look on Buntee’s 
face while sitting on the elephant’s back. “I cannot 
see you go hungry,” said the farmer, “If you miss 
your friend so much, go to him.”
The farmer removed the rope with which 
he had tied the dog. The dog, though weak,

sprang to his feet. He licked the farmer’s hand 
once and then ran. He stopped only when he 
arrived at the stable.
The elephant picked up the dog with his 
trunk and gave him a joyous swing. The 
mahout was relieved. He quickly brought the 
food. “Both of you eat first,” he said. 
By then the farmer who had followed the 
dog, joined him. The two of them watched 
with satisfaction the two friends eating food. 
“It’s not only Gajaraj who has found a friend,” 
said the mahout hugging the farmer, “I’ve also 
found one.”

 2. Who were friends at the end of the story?
 
Let us think and reflect
 1. Read the following lines and answer the questions that follow.
 
(a) In spite of royal comforts, Gajaraj was sad because he had no friends. 
The mahout, or elephant trainer, was the only one he ever interacted 
with. The mahout was a kind man who served Gajaraj food, and gave 
him a bath in the elephant pond daily. He was a good caretaker, but 
not a friend.

(ii) The mahout was a good caretaker because he gave _________ 
to Gajaraj and a ______ in the pond.
 
(iii) What do you think is the difference between a friend and 
a caretaker?
 
(b) “Are you missing your friend?” asked the farmer remembering the 
happy look on Buntee’s face while sitting on the elephant’s back. “I 
cannot see you go hungry,” said the farmer, “If you miss your friend 
so much, go to him.” The farmer removed the rope with which he had 
tied the dog.
 
(i) The farmer uses the word __________________ to refer to the 
elephant.
 
(ii) How did the farmer know that Buntee was hungry?
 
(iii) Why did the farmer remove the rope with which he had 
tied Buntee?
 
(iv) Complete with one word: 
 
 
Gajaraj : Buntee : : __________ : farmer
 2. Give two examples to show that Gajaraj was very happy to have a friend.
 3. How did the mahout come to know that Gajaraj was sad? 
 4. Why do you think Buntee licked the farmer’s hand?
 5. What was ‘unlikely’ about the friendship of Gajaraj and Buntee? 
 
Let us learn 
 1. Gajaraj was sad without a friend and when he met Buntee, he was filled 
with joy. ‘Sad’ and ‘filled with joy’ are opposites. Opposites can also be 
formed by adding some letters before a word. For example, un- unhappy, 
in- incorrect, dis- disconnect, mis- misuse.
 
 Now, take help from the words given as hints and fill up their opposites 
in the puzzle. (Note: All the words are from the story you have just read.)

 3. The words that tell us about an action are called verbs. In the story, 
the author tells us what happened before. To do that, the past form of 
the action word (verb) is used. Let us learn about the three forms of 
past tense. 
Simple Past Tense
Past Progressive Tense
Past Perfect Tense
Used to show that the 
action had happened 
earlier.
• second form of the 
verb + add -d or -ed to 
the verb
Used to show that the 
action did not finish 
and was going on.
• I/He/She/It + was + 
verb + ing
• We/You/They + were + 
verb + ing
Used to show that the 
action was completed.
• had + third form of 
the verb
 
 Given below are some verbs from the story. Put the verbs in their correct 
column in the table given above.

 Select the correct form of the verb to complete the passage. Check your 
answers with the teacher.
 
 The farmer came back and ____________ (noticed/was noticing/had 
noticed) that Buntee was sad. He ____________ (tied/ was tying/had tied) 
Buntee with a rope the day before. He ____________ (asked/was asking/ 
had asked) Buntee why he was sad. Farmer ____________ (felt/was feeling/ 
had felt) that Buntee ____________ (missed/was missing/had missed) 
Gajaraj and set him free.
 4. ‘…neither the farmer nor the mahout noticed that the two friends were 
in tears.’ 
 
 The words ‘neither’, ‘nor’ are used to state that the farmer and the 
mahout did not notice the same thing. ‘Neither, nor’ connect two negative 
choices. For example: Neither Rohit nor I want to play football.
 
 When you need to choose between two things that you want, you may use 
‘either, or’. For example: Rohit wants to play either cricket or kho-kho. 
It means Rohit wants to play cricket or Rohit wants to play kho-kho. 
Discuss the given sentences with your teacher to practice. 
 
• Neither Shikha nor Anuj like to tell stories.
 
• Either Bhavesh or Abha made this painting.
 
Let us listen 
 1. You will listen to a story about ‘Unlikely Friends’. Use exact words from

May my friendships always be
The most important thing to me.
With special friends I feel I’m blessed,
So let me give my very best.
I want to do much more than share
The hopes and plans of friends who care;
I’ll try all that a friend can do
To make their wishes come true.
Let me use my heart to see,
To realise what friends can be,
And make no judgements from afar,
But love my friends the way they are.

There was a boy called Mario who loved 
to have lots of friends. He showed off a lot, 
always talking about how many friends he 
had at school, and how he was so friendly with 
everyone.
One day his grandfather said to him, “Mario, 
I bet you a fruit chaat. You don’t have as many 
friends as you think you have. I’m sure many 
of them are nothing more than companions or 
partners.”
Mario accepted the bet readily. However, 
he wasn’t sure how he could test whether his 
schoolmates were real friends or not. So, he 
asked his grandpa for help. He suggested, “I 
have exactly what you need. It’s in the attic. 
Wait here a minute.”
Grandpa left, soon returning as though 
carrying something in his hand, but Mario 
could see nothing there. 
“Take it. It’s a very special chair. As it’s 
invisible, it’s rather tricky to sit on it. But if you 
take it to school and manage to sit on it, then

Mario, brave and determined, took the strange 
invisible chair and set off for school. At break 
time, he asked everyone to form a circle. He 
put himself in the middle, with his chair.

something amazing.”

Mario tried sitting on the chair. Having 
difficulty seeing it, he missed and fell straight 
onto his backside. His classmates had a pretty 
good laugh.
“Wait, 
wait, 
just 
a 
slight 
technical 
problem,” he said, trying again. But again, 
he missed the seat, causing more surprised 
looks and laughter. Mario wouldn’t give up. 
He kept trying to sit on the magic chair and 
kept falling to the ground until, suddenly, he 
tried again and didn’t fall. This time he sat, 
hanging in mid-air.
Then he finally experienced the magic 
that his grandfather had been talking about. 
Looking around, Mario saw Guneet, Asma, and 
Deepa–three of his buddies—holding him up, 
so he wouldn’t fall. Meanwhile, many others 
experienced:

he’d thought of as friends had done nothing but made fun of him, 
enjoying each and every fall.
Leaving with his three friends, he explained to them how 
his grandfather had so cleverly thought of a way to show him 
that true friends are those who care for us. A friend wouldn’t be 
someone who takes joy in our bad luck.
That evening the four children went to see Mario’s grandpa 
as he had won the bet. They had a great time listening to stories 
and eating a lot of fruit chaat. From then on, they used the magic 
chair test on many occasions and whoever passed became friends 
for life.

Let me tell you a story of a cow and a leopard from Vadodara 
in Gujarat who became friends. As you know, a leopard is a 
wild animal and a cow is a domestic animal. Some people 
say that the cow took care of the leopard cub like a mother. 
When the cub became older, it went away from the village. 
It returned to meet the cow at night. The villagers were 
worried but they never stopped the leopard. They saw that 
the leopard just sat beside the cow quietly. The cow and 
leopard spent time by relaxing and playing with each other. 
The leopard did not like the villagers and stopped coming 
regularly. The villagers were surprised that the leopard 
never attacked the cow but became its friend.

Hello!
Let me tell you what outdoor activities Ajay and Dhiraj 
enjoy doing. Some days they like playing at the swings in 
the park. Ajay enjoys slides the most. Dhiraj likes nature, 
so both take walks in the nearby park, listen to birds and 
look at the trees. On Saturdays, both go cycling around the 
neighbourhood. What both truly enjoy is eating ice-cream 
together. Sometimes they also purchase a comic book, sit on 
a park bench and read together. They are truly best friends.

When I first joined this new school, things were very difficult. 
There was Monika. She was a supportive friend who guided 
me, introduced me to others and even shared her notes. 
That made me comfortable in the school. Since then, Monika 
and I have been together through difficult times and happy 
times. She is the kind of friend who is always there for you. 
I’m really thankful for her, and how her help and support 
turned into a really good friendship.
