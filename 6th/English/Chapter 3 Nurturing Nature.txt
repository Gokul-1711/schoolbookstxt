            school and sat down in
            the shade of the neem
            tree in her courtyard.
            She felt that the tree
            was whispering to her.
            She looked at the tree
            and spoke to the tree.

                               May I?
            Neem Baba : Sure, dear Amber. I know you. You played in my
                        shade in your childhood. You may call me ‘Neem
                        Baba’.

                               something more about yourself.
            Neem Baba : I am very old. I was born millions of years ago
                        somewhere in North India or Myanmar. Soon, my
                        family spread outside India.
            Amber            : Outside India? Where else can neem be found?
            Neem Baba : My family can be found in many Asian and African
                        countries and even in some parts of America.

            Amber        : Really?
            Neem Baba : Yes, in Hindi, my name is Nimb. In

                        known for what we do. People
                        find us useful and that is why

            Amber       : Yes, I once had a cough and I
                          could not breathe properly. My
                          grandmother cured me with a
                          medicine made from neem bark.
                          And when my father had itching

                          from neem flowers, which cured
                          him.
            Neem Baba : Oh, little Amber, you know so

                          farmers?

                     compound words, based on how the words are separated.
                     • Open compound words: spaces between the words.
                     • Closed compound words: no spaces between the words.
                     • Hyphenated compound words: hyphens between the words.

                 3. Neem Baba speaks to Amber as if he is a person. This figure of speech is
                    called personification. Let us look at some more examples.
                    • The leaves whispered in the wind.
                    • The flowers danced merrily in the breeze.
            		 Now, discuss it with your classmates and teacher.


                      Let us listen
            		 You will now listen to a boy speaking to his mother. As you listen, select
               the correct statements. (refer to page 101 for transcript)
                   (a) The mother was surprised to know that Peepal Baba had planted
                       trees all over the country.
                   (b) The mother disliked the work being done by Peepal Baba.
                   (c) The mother wanted to know more about Peepal Baba.
                   (d) The boy decided to take care of trees by listening to Peepal Baba’s
                       journey.
                   (e) The boy was worried about what his teacher had told him.


                      Let us speak
                   Collect dry leaves of four different
                   trees and plants around you.
                   1. Make one card as given below. On
                      the top, draw the shape of the leaf
                      looking at the dry leaf and colour
                      it. Inside the card, write the name
                      of the tree/plant the leaf is taken
                      from and one of its uses.
                   2. Now, speak about the whole process of making the card in front of the
                      class.
                   3. Ask your classmates to identify the leaf and tell them one of its uses.
                      After they answer, open the card, and share what you have written.

                        Let us write
                      You have read about Neem Baba and learnt many things about the neem
                      tree. Look at the trees in your neighbourhood and write a paragraph
                      about any one tree that you like.
                      • Where it is (roadside / park,  etc.)
                      • How it looks (height, tree trunk, leaves, flowers, etc.)
                      • Why you like it (shade, medicinal properties, shelter, beauty, etc.)
                      • Give a title to your paragraph.


                        Let us explore
            When people from Persia came to India and saw that a common tree of their
            country was freely growing here, they started calling the tree Azad Darakhte
            Hindi. So, the scientific name of Neem in Latin became Azadirachta indica.
            Neem has different names in the Indian languages. Discuss with your teacher
            and find out which Indian languages these names belong to.

            Let us do these activities before we read.
                 1. Look at the picture and discuss what you see in the picture with your
                    teacher and classmates.
            		 Think of a time when you worked hard. What did you do then?
                    • How did it help you?
                    • How did it make you feel?
            		 Also, discuss in groups.
                 2. Where are the places you see birds?
                    What do you see the birds doing?
                 3. Do you want to fly like a bird? Why?
                 4. What does a baby bird think about its
                    world?
                 5. Read the sentences and replace the
                    underlined words with their correct
                    meanings.

                      Let us read

            I lived first in a little house,
            And lived there very well,
            I thought the world was small and round,
            And made of pale, blue shell.

            I lived next in a little nest,
            Nor needed any other,
            I thought the world was made of straw,
            And nestled by my mother.

            One day, I fluttered from my nest,
            To see what I could find,
            I said the world is made of leaves,
            I have been very blind.

            At length I flew beyond the tree,
            Quite fit for grown-up labours,
            I don’t know how the world is made,
            And neither do my neighbours.

                    • What do you look like? [I am ….......……. in colour. I am a big/small
                      bird. I have ….......…….].
                    • Where do you live? [I live in ….......……. It is (where) ….......…….]
                    • What do you do during the day? [ I ….......……. I also ….......…….]
                    • Do you have any message for humans? [ I want to tell the humans
                      ….......…….]


                      Let us write
                 1. Read how the bird perceived its world.
                   My world was small, round and light blue at first. After that my world
                   was warm and comfortable. It was made of straw. In this world I could
                   only see leaves whenever I stepped out. In the end, my world became
                   big. It had the sky and the earth as a part of it.
                 2. Now, discuss with your teacher and classmates how you think the world
                    would look to the following.
                   (a) a baby      (b) a fish
                 3. Now, write five sentences each, for both (a) and (b), in your notebooks.
                    You can take help from the example given in 1.



                      Let us explore
                 1. The bird’s first home was made of a shell. Later its home was among
                    leaves and made of straw.
                    • Look at your home carefully and make a list of all the materials it is
                      made of.
                    • Why do you think our homes are not made of straw?
                    • If you had to own a home of your choice, what would it look like and
                      what materials would you like to use?
                    • How is a home different from a house? Discuss with your classmates
                      and teacher.



                                                                                              91

                      • Look at the list of some workers who build houses. Find out the
                        work they do and write, as shown in the example. You can think of
                        other workers and add them too.

                 2. Look at the different kinds of nests and homes the birds make. Have you
                    seen any? Discuss these type of nests with your teacher and classmates.

                 3. Do you know if these spices can be used for something else other than
                    cooking? Let us find out by reading the letter given below.

                      Dear Vikram and Vaibhavi,
                      Namaste! I just got your message that you are better now.
                      I am happy that the natural cures that I had shared, helped you. You should
                      try to remember these cures and may share them with your friends. When
                      I was a child, I learnt them from my grandmother. She used to find home
                      remedies for most of the weather-related common illnesses. Let me share
                      some of the benefits of the spices that most of us have in our kitchen.
                      Let me start with haldi, which is called turmeric in English. It helps in improving
                      our energy level and digestion. It helps in reducing body pain too.
                      Next, let us take methi, which is called fenugreek in English. You will be
                      surprised to know that it helps me in keeping my sugar level and my body
                      weight in control. I need to soak the methi seeds overnight and drink the water
                      in the morning.
                      • Jeera (cumin) seeds soaked in water overnight can also improve digestion and
                        help cure sleeplessness.
                      • You know, when you were babies and had gas in your tummy, I used to put
                        heeng (asafoetida) water on your tummy to give you some relief. Heeng
                        can also help in controlling cough and cold.
                      • Dalchini (cinnamon) and laung (clove) give relief when we have toothache
                        till we can consult a dentist.
                      • Adrak (ginger) is another herb that can help us when we have cough and
                        cold. It also gives relief from pain. Do you know, ginger has been used for
                        cooking for more than 4000 years? Even today, it is extensively used in
                        cooking Indian food.
                      • Kali mirch (black pepper) is also helpful in digestion and can give us relief
                        from body pain.
                      • You may have seen that at the end of a meal, saunf (fennel seeds) and
                        ajwain (carom seeds) are served. It is because they help in the digestion of
                        food.
                      • Elaichi (cardamom) also helps us with digestion and respiratory troubles
                        in addition to curing bad breath.

                    Now, go into the kitchen and try to identify these herbs and spices. And
                    remember, you must consult an elder before you use them.
                    My love and aashirwaad to both of you!

                    Yours affectionately,

                      Let us think and reflect
                 1. Read the given lines and answer the following questions.
            		‘When I was a child, I learnt them from my grandmother. She used to find
              cures for most of the weather-related common illnesses in the kitchen.’
                   (a) Where exactly in the kitchen did her grandmother find the cures?
                   (b) Give one example of weather-related common illnesses.
                   (c) What kind of relationship did the speaker have with her grandmother?
                 2. Fill in the blanks to complete the sentence.
            		
             Daadi soaked methi seeds overnight and drank the water in the morning
                    to manage _____________________ and _____________________.
                 3. Circle the spice that is not useful for body pain according
                    to Daadi’s letter.
                   (a) Turmeric              (c) Fennel seeds
                   (b) Ginger                (d) Black pepper
                 4. Why did Daadi ask Vikram and Vaibhavi to share the natural cures with
                    their friends?
                 5. What was Daadi’s final advice to Vikram and Vaibhavi?
                 6. How do we know that natural cures are passed from one generation
                    to another?
                 7. Why do you think we should know about the healing properties
                    of spices?

                                            Peepal Baba
                  Rahul    : Maa, have you heard about Peepal Baba? Our teacher told us
                             about him today.
                  Mother : I have not heard about him. Who is he and what does he do?
                  Rahul    : He plants trees along with his team. He also started a
                             movement to plant and save trees.
                  Mother : That’s wonderful. Where did he get this idea from?
                  Rahul    : When he was studying in a school in Pune, his English teacher
                             gave him the idea to plant trees. He was just 11 years old.
                  Mother : How did he plant so many trees all over the country as a child?
                  Rahul    : He was born to an army officer’s family in Chandigarh and
                             whenever they were moved to a new city, he planted more trees.
                  Mother : But how did he come to be known as Peepal Baba?
                  Rahul    : He used to plant Peepal and Neem trees as they have many
                             uses for us and told others to do so. So, in the beginning, people
                             made fun of him by calling him Peepal Baba but he was not
                             bothered and continued to do his work. Now everyone calls
                             him by that name lovingly.
                  Mother : He is really doing great work. We should learn from him and
                           plant more trees.
                  Rahul    : Yes, Maa. We must and tell others to do the same.

                                      Spices that Heal us
                  The wonder herb: Tulsi is a shrub in the basil family. It is said that it was
                  first found in north central India and now grows almost everywhere in
                  India. It is known as ‘the Queen of Herbs’ and has many medicinal uses.
                  Studies show that it helps to decrease glucose and cholesterol levels
                  and improve blood pressure. It is commonly used to treat breathing
                  and digestion disorders. As it has anti-bacterial properties, it is used
                  in herbal hand sanitisers. It is used as a base for making herbal mouth
                  wash and toothpaste for treating bad breath, gum disease and mouth
                  ulcers.
                      Tulsi leaves can be washed and eaten raw. We can also add Tulsi
                  leaves when we make tea. Tulsi tea helps in dealing with stress as it calms
                  our mind. Tulsi protects us from a vast range of pollutants around us.
