                           worldwide as a land of wise
                           and heroic individuals. Its
                           rich and diverse culture has
                           attracted numerous travellers
                           since ancient times. The
                           people here live in unison,
                           presenting to the world unity
                           in diversity. Bharat is a land
                           rich with rivers, lakes, and
                           high mountains. Its green
                           forests are home to many
                           plants, insects, birds, and
                           animals. All these elements
                           ensure that Bharat prospers
                           and is respected globally. As
                           its inhabitants, we need to
                           continue working hard and

            “So, are you ready to meet your friends from all over the country?”
            the teacher asked the students sitting in the big hall.
               “Yes!” was the loud answer from the class.
               “Can someone tell me for which programme are we here?”
            the teacher asked.
               “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat”, the students answered together
            again.
               “Please raise your hand to tell me what it is all about,” the
            teacher said.
               Many hands went up and some were jumping to answer. The
            teacher asked Renu. With a smile on her face, she said, “It is to
            know that we all belong to one nation and that is the bond we
            share. And our unity in diversity makes us the most wonderful
            country in the world.”

              1. What is the Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat programme all about?
              2. Why is this programme being conducted?

            The teacher smiled at her as everyone clapped. Just then, Bala
            pointed out, “Look! The video has started!” The big screen now
            had little windows each with a smiling child. Each child had
            something to share.

            with white rice flour
            paste on brick-red
            walls coloured with geru. It is made on floors
            and walls of puja rooms, and outside the main
            door of the home. It is an art form made by
            the women in the family. The designs are very
            beautiful and mathematical, and are based on
            our cultural traditions, and observations of
            nature.
               Suprabhat!     I     am
            Priyaranjan from Odisha.
            My tribe practises a
            4000-year-old metal craft
            named Dhokra. To begin,
            we make a figure with
            clay, dry it, and cover
            it with a layer of wax.                Dhokra          carve: to make
            Then, we carve the fine                                design with
            details on the wax. After that, we cover the figure    sharp tool
            with clay, and put it in the fire. The wax melts and
            comes out of small openings. Next, brass scrap         scrap: small
            is melted and poured into the empty space. The         unwanted pieces

            liquid metal takes the same shape as the wax.

            Finally, we remove the outer layer of clay and
            finish the metal figure as we want.

            the outside and inside of a
            brown coconut shell. After      Coconut shell craft

            that, we make it smooth by using sandpaper or
            a machine. Then we give it the shape we want,
            and make it stable by fixing a base under it.           stable: not able

            At last, we polish it using wood polish to make
            it shine. We make household things like bowls
            and even jewellery from the coconut shells. It          biodegradable:

            is a biodegradable craft.

                                   Like coloured birds
                                 In the wind-whipped sky.

                                    And sail up there.

                                 Then I would drift upon

                       The poet uses simile in (a) and (b) to compare the kites with
                       coloured birds and the quality of being light as air. The poet uses
                       ‘like’ and ‘as’ to compare.

                  Do you think that the use of simile in this poem helps us imagine better
                  when we read the poem? Share your thoughts with your teacher and
                  classmates.
              3. Find a set of words from the poem that begin with the same consonant

                  Which consonant sound do both words begin with?
                  Stanza 3
                  Which consonant sound do both words begin with?
                  This is called alliteration. For example, big bright blue bag, funny fan,
                  etc.
                  Create 4 other sets of words using alliteration.
              4. In the last stanza, the two words that the poet repeats are __________,
                 __________ to tell us that the kite is flying __ __ __ y high.
              5. Study each stanza and underline the rhyming words from the end of
                 each line. Also, circle the end words in the stanzas that do not rhyme.



                    Let us think and reflect
              1. Read the given lines from the poem and answer the following questions.
            			        What fun it would be
            			        To look right down,

                      the kite?
                  (c) What are the songs that the child hears when flying atop the kite?
                  (d) Why did the people look up at the child and stare? If you looked up

                      in the poetry of the thirteenth-century Marathi saint and poet,
                      Namadeva. In his poems or gathas, he called a kite a gudi, and there
                      is a mention that the kites were made from kaagad (paper).

            Let us do these activities before we read.
              1. Look at the given picture and information. Discuss the questions with
                 your teacher and classmates.



                                                        Pranav M. Balasubramaniam is
                                                        from Palakkad in Kerala. Though
                                                        he was born without both hands,
                                                        he has excelled as an artist, a
                                                        singer, and a para-sportsperson.



                  (a) Do you think Pranav’s task is simple? Why or why not?
                  (b) How does Pranav’s special ability make you feel?
                  (c) What qualities do you think were important for Pranav to become
                     successful?
                  (d) What message does Pranav’s story give us?
              2. Look at the picture of Kathiawar embroidery. Discuss in pairs.
                  (a) List the steps you think are needed to
                      create this embroidery.
                  (b) Discuss if these steps can be done
                      with feet, instead of hands.
                  (c) What efforts would be needed if
                      someone has to embroider with their
                      feet? Do you think it is possible?

                   Let us read
             1. When you enter a tiny room in Moti Vavdi
                village, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, you will see
                lots of bright colours. There are many
                lovely things like cushions, bedcovers,
                pillows, and more, with beautiful designs.
                Ila Sachani, a wonderful lady with a big
                smile, makes all these using a shiny needle
                                                                   Ila Sachani
                to create these designs. She is very good at
                Kathiawar embroidery—a style that needs
                a lot of skill.
             2. Ila Sachani’s journey began in the quiet
                settings of Amreli, Gujarat, where she
                was born into a farmer’s family. From the
                beginning, life presented its challenges,      challenges:
                as Ila was born with her hands hanging         difficulties
                loose by her sides. Unlike other children,
                she could not use her hands in the usual
                way. While other small hands drew figures
                in the sand or plucked wild flowers, she
                wondered why she could not join them.
                She too wanted to hold a chalk in her hands
                and draw figures on a slate.
             3. Ila’s mother and grandmother
                encouraged the little girl and
                were single-minded to help her
                overcome her challenge. They
                were skilled in the traditional art
                of Kathiawar embroidery and
                decided to share this art with Ila.            single-minded:
                They taught her to create many                 focused

                                                                   Culture and Tradition




                  beautiful patterns using her feet! It was
                  certainly not an easy task, but Ila accepted
                  the challenge with determination. Her             determination:
                  parents also helped her learn to do things        will power
                  with her legs, like eating and combing her
                  hair.
             4. Threading a needle was hard, but Ila did
                not give up and became an expert at a
                young age. Her younger brother and sister
                helped her too. She learned many styles,
                even ones from outside Gujarat—Kachhi,
                Kashmiri, Lucknawi and others.
             5. For Ila, embroidery became a way to express
                herself. At first, she crafted fine designs
                only for her family and friends, who were           awestruck:
                awestruck by her talent. They talked about          amazed

                those designs to others. Soon, the people in
                the village, too, discovered Ila’s special skill
                and the admiration for her work began to
                spread.
             6. Word reached the government office, in
                Surat. They were moved by Ila’s story and
                impressed by her work. They decided to
                display some samples of her embroidery
                at a state exhibition. This experience
                opened new doors for Ila. People observed
                the beauty woven by her feet and readily
                purchased the creations. Ila was no more a
                hidden talent, but famous!

             7. Encouraged by this popularity, Ila            popularity:
                participated in more exhibitions, not just    fame
                within the state but at the national level.
                She received many awards and honours,
                not just for her art but also the willpower
                and creativity that her work showed. Ila
                Sachani, once a farmer’s daughter facing a
                tough challenge, worked hard and became
                a celebrated artist and receiver of the
                President’s Medal.
             8. The most important change for Ila was
                the new independence. Through her skill,
                she not only earned a regular income but
                also found joy in doing what she loved.
                She proved, through her creations, that
                challenges can be turned into victories
                with focus, hard work, positivity and never
                giving up.
             9. Her embroidery, created with her feet,
                reminds us that art has the power to rise
                above physical boundaries and touch
                the soul.

            		 Unlike other children, she could not use her hands in the usual way. While
               other small hands drew figures in the sand or plucked wild flowers, she
               wondered why she could not join them. She too wanted to hold a chalk in
               her hands and draw figures on a slate.

              4. Why was the first state exhibition an important event in Ila’s life?
              5. What does the sentence, ‘art has the power to rise above physical
                 boundaries and touch the soul’, tell us about the power of art?
              6. How can we be helpful and encouraging like Ila’s family and friends

                               Kalakritiyon ka Bharat
                  Namaste! You must be tired and hungry after listening to so
                  many people. I am Sushil from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
                  Let me tell you a unique dish of my district. It is called gakkad
                  bharta. First, we make gakkad from wheat dough. Then, we
                  make balls with that dough and roast them on high heat.
                  To make bharta, we roast brinjals and tomatoes. Then we
                  garnish the bharta with chopped onions, coriander, green
                  chillis and salt. This food item is made without frying. To eat
                  it, you simply crumble the gakkad and drizzle it with some
                  bharta and a spoonful of ghee. Come to Jabalpur and try it!




                  You will listen to the audio or narration once again. As you
                  listen, check your answers.

                                          The Kites
                  Hello everyone! I’m happy to share with you some details
                  about the Kite Festival. It is a popular festival in India and it
                  takes place during Makar Sankranti in the month of January.
                  People can even be seen flying kites from their terraces and
                  rooftops and taking part in kite flying competitions.
                     This festival is celebrated as Uttarayan in Western India.
                  The festival gives everyone a chance to look at kites of
                  different shapes, sizes and colours. Gujarat is the main centre
                  of celebrations but Uttarayan is also celebrated in Rajasthan
                  and Telangana. In Karnataka, the Tourism Department has
                  also been organising the kite festival once each year. Punjab
                  also celebrates this festival of kites during Baisakhi and
                  Basant Panchami.
                     Kite flying is a tradition that is deep-rooted in Indian
                  culture and the Kite Festival is one that is eagerly awaited.
                  This is also a reason why people across India also fly kites to
                  celebrate Independence Day. Happy kite-flying to all of you!

                      Embroidering Dreams with her Feet
                  Hello everyone! I’m here today to share some simple
                  information about Kathiawar embroidery. This is a very old
                  form of embroidery. It uses many bright colours and also uses
                  many types of stitches, like the chain stitch. The embroidery
                  is commonly seen on clothes and home decoration items.
                  On clothes, it is seen on children’s caps, ghagra skirts and
                  men’s traditional shirts. In this embroidery, a lot of mirror
                  work is done by fitting small mirrors along with the stitches.
                  Most commonly, the designs used are geometric shapes like
                  squares and triangles. The design of flowers is also used.
                  There is much more to share but I’ll do that some other time.
                  Thank you!
