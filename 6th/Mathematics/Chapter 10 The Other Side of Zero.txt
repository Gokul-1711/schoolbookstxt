More and more numbers!
Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of
mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …
Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example,
there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before
1. The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the
world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in
the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write
numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits.
We then learned about more numbers that exist between the
numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 1 , 3 , and 13 . These are called
2
2
6
fractions.
But are there still more numbers? Well, 0 is an additional number
that we didn’t know about earlier, and it comes before 1 and is less
than 1. Are there perhaps more numbers that come before 0 and are
less than 0?
Phrased another way, we have seen the number line:
0

However, this is actually only a number ‘ray’, in the language we
learned earlier in geometry; this ray starts at 0 and goes forever to
the right. Do there exist numbers to the left of 0, so that this number
ray can be completed to a true number line?
That is what we will investigate in this chapter!

Can there be a number less than 0? Can you think of any ways to
have less than 0 of something?

10.1 Bela’s Building of Fun
Children flock to Bela’s ice cream factory to see
and taste her tasty ice cream. To make it even
more fun for them, Bela purchased a multistoried building and filled it with attractions.
She named it Bela’s Building of Fun.
But this was no ordinary building!
Observe that some of the floors in the
‘Building of Fun’ are below the ground. What are the shops that you
find on these floors? What is there on the ground floor?
A lift is used to go up and down between the floors. It has two
buttons: ‘+’ to go up and ‘–’ to go down. Can you spot the lift?
To go to the Art Centre from the ‘Welcome Hall’, you
must press the ‘+’ button twice.
We say that the button press is + + or + 2.
To go down two floors, you must press the ‘–’
button twice, which we write as – – or – 2.
So if you press + 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘+’
button once), then you will go up one floor and if
you press – 1 (i.e., if you press the ‘–’ button
once), then you will go down 1 floor.
Lift button presses and numbers:
+++ is written as + 3
– – – – is written as – 4

What do you press to go four floors up?
What do you press to go three floors down?

Numbering the floors in the building of fun
Entry to the ‘Building of Fun’ is at the ground floor level and is called
the ‘Welcome Hall’. Starting from the ground floor, you can reach the
Food Court by pressing + 1 and can reach the Art Centre by pressing
+ 2. So, we can say that the Food Court is on Floor + 1 and that the Art
Centre is on Floor + 2.
Starting from the ground floor, you must press – 1 to reach the Toy
Store. So, the Toy Store is on Floor – 1 similarly starting from the ground
floor, you must press – 2 to reach the Video Games shop. So, the Video
Games shop is on Floor – 2.
The ground floor is called Floor 0. Can you see why?
Number all the floors in the Building of Fun.
Did you notice that + 3 is the floor number of the Book
Store, but it is also the number of floors you move
when you press + 3? Similarly, – 3 is the floor number
but it is also the number of floors you go down when
you press – 3, i.e., when you press – – – .
A number with a ‘+’ sign in front is called a positive
number. A number with a ‘–’ sign in front is called a
negative number.
In the ‘Building of Fun’, the floors are numbered
using the ground floor, Floor 0, as a reference or starting
point. The floors above the ground floor are numbered
with positive numbers. To get to them from the ground
floor, one must press the ‘+’ button some number of
times. The floors below the ground are numbered with
negative numbers. To get to them from the ground floor,
one must press the ‘–’ button some number of times.
Zero is neither a positive nor a negative number.
We do not put a ‘+’ or ‘–’ sign in front of it.

Addition to keep track of movement
Start from the Food Court and press + 2 in the lift. Where will you
reach? ____________
We can describe this using an expression:
Starting Floor + Movement = Target Floor.
The starting floor is + 1 (Food Court) and the number of button
presses is + 2. Therefore, you reach the target floor (+ 1) + (+ 2) = + 3
(Book Store).
Figure it Out
1. You start from Floor + 2 and press – 3 in the lift. Where will you
reach? Write an expression for this movement.

2.

Evaluate these expressions (you may think of them as Starting
Floor + Movement by referring to the Building of Fun).
a. (+ 1) + (+ 4) = _______
b. (+ 4) + (+ 1) = _______
d. (– 1) + (+ 2) = _______
c. (+ 4) + (–  3) = _______
e. (– 1) + (+ 1) = _______
f.
0 + (+ 2) = _________
g.
0 + (– 2) = _________

3.	Starting from different floors, find the movements required to
reach Floor – 5. For example, if I start at Floor + 2, I must press – 7
to reach Floor – 5. The expression is (+ 2) + (– 7) = – 5.
	Find more such starting positions and the movements needed to
reach Floor – 5 and write the expressions.

Combining button presses is also addition
Gurmit was in the Toy Store and wanted to go down two floors.
But by mistake he pressed the ‘+’ button two times. He realised his
mistake and quickly pressed the ‘–’ button three times. How many
floors below or above the Toy Store will Gurmit reach?
Gurmit will go one floor down. We can show the movement
resulting from combining button presses as an expression:
(+ 2) + (– 3) = – 1.

Back to zero!
On the ground floor, Basant is in a great hurry and by
mistake he presses +3. What can he do to cancel it and
stay on the ground floor? He can cancel it by pressing
– 3. That is, (+3) + (– 3) = 0.
We call – 3 the inverse of +3. Similarly, the inverse of
– 3 is +3.
If Basant now presses +4 and then presses – 4 in the
lift, where will he reach?
Here is another way to think of the concept of
inverse. If you are at Floor +4 and you press its inverse
– 4, then you are back to zero, the ground floor! If you
are at Floor – 2 and press its inverse +2, then you go to
(– 2) + (+2) = 0, again the ground floor!
 Write the inverses of these numbers:

Subtraction to find which button to press

In earlier classes, we understood the meaning of subtraction as ‘take
away’. For example, there are 10 books on the shelf. I take away 4
books. How many are left on the shelf?
We can express the answer using subtraction: 10 – 4 = 6 or ‘Ten
take away four is six.’

247

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 247

13-08-2024 17:32:08

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

You may also be familiar with another meaning of subtraction which
is related to comparison or making quantities equal. For example,
consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6.
Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my
sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ
We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10 Or 10 – 6 = ?
Here, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number
to be added’ and subtraction.
For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use
this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing
number to be added’.
 Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective.
Teacher’s Note
In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can
indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction
shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to
become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels,
what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting
Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase)
or negative (for a decrease).

Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the
Sports Centre. What should be your button press?
You need to go three floors up, so you should press + 3. We can
write this as an expression using subtraction:
Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed.
In the above example, the starting floor is + 2 (Art Centre) and
the target floor is + 5. The button press to get to + 5 from + 2 is + 3.
Therefore,
(+ 5) – (+ 2) = + 3

Explanation
Recall the connection between addition and subtraction. For 3 + ? = 5,
we can find the missing number using subtraction: 5 – 3 = 2. That is,
subtraction is the same as finding the missing number to be added.
We know that —
Starting Floor + Movement needed = Target Floor
If the movement needed is to be found, then,
Starting Floor + ? = Target Floor
So,
Target Floor – Starting Floor = ? = Movement needed
More examples:
a. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button
should you press?
You need to go one floor up, so, you should press + 1.
Expression: (– 1) – (– 2) = (+1)
b. If the Target Floor is – 1 and Starting floor is +3, what button
should you press?
You need to go four floors down, so, you should press – 4.
Expression: (– 1) – (+ 3) = (– 4)
c. If the Target Floor is +2 and Starting Floor is – 2, what button
should you press?
You need to go four floors up, so, you should press +4.
Expression: (+ 2) – (– 2) = (+ 4)

Adding and subtracting larger numbers

+

The picture shows a mine, a place where
minerals are extracted by digging into the
rock. The truck is at the ground level, but
the minerals are present both above and
below the ground level. There is a fast
moving lift which moves up and down in
a mineshaft carrying people and ore.
Some of the levels are marked in the
picture. The ground level is marked 0.
Levels above the ground are marked by
positive numbers and levels below the
ground are marked by negative numbers.
The number indicates how many metres
above or below the ground level it is.
In the mine, just like in the Building of Fun:
Starting Level + Movement = Target Level
For example,
(+ 40) + (+ 60) = + 100		

(– 90) + (– 55) = – 145

Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
For example,
(+ 40) – (– 50) = + 90 		

(– 90) – (+ 40) = – 130

How many negative numbers are there?
Bela’s Building of Fun had only six floors above and five floors below.
That is numbers – 5 to + 6. In the mine above, we have numbers from
– 200 to + 180. But we can imagine larger buildings or mineshafts.
Just as positive numbers + 1, + 2, + 3, ... keep going up without an end,
similarly, negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, ... keep going down. Positive
and negative numbers, with zero, are called integers. They go both
ways from 0: … – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …

To add and subtract even larger integers, we can imagine even larger
lifts! In fact, we can imagine a lift that can extend forever upwards
and forever downwards, starting from Level 0. There does not even
have to be any building or mine around — just an ‘infinite lift’!

We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like.

For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000
– (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground
and 200 below the ground. Recall that,
Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed
To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we
must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after
that to get to + 2200). Therefore, (+ 2000) – (– 200) = + 2200.
Notice that (+ 2000) + (+ 200) is also + 2200.
Try evaluating the following expressions by similarly drawing or
imagining a suitable lift:
a. – 125 + (– 30)
c. + 105 + (+ 55)
e. + 80 + (+ 150)

In the above example, we saw that + 2000 – (– 200) = + 2000 + (+ 200)
= + 2200. In other words, subtracting a negative number is the same
as adding the corresponding positive number. That is, we can
replace subtraction of a negative number by addition of a positive
number!
In the other exercises that you did above, did you notice
that subtracting a negative number was the same as adding
the corresponding positive number?

Take a look at the ‘infinite lift’ above. Does it remind you
of a number line? In what ways?

Back to the number line
The ‘infinite lift’ we saw above looked very much like a number line,
didn’t it? In fact, if we rotate it by 90°, it basically becomes a number
line. It also tells us how to complete the number ray to a number line,
answering the question that we had asked at the beginning of the
chapter. To the left of 0 are the negative numbers – 1, – 2, – 3, …
Usually we drop the ‘+’ sign on positive numbers and simply write
them as 1, 2, 3, …
– 10 – 9 – 8 – 7 – 6 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1

Instead of traveling along the number line using a lift, we can
simply imagine walking on it. To the right is the positive (forward)
direction, and to the left is the negative (backward) direction.
Smaller numbers are now to the left of bigger numbers and
bigger numbers are to the right of smaller numbers. So, 2 < 5;
– 3 < 2; and – 5 < – 3.
If, from 5 you wish to go over to 9, how far must you travel along
the number line?

You must travel 4 steps. That is why 5 + 4 = 9.
(Remember: Starting Number + Movement = Target Number)
The corresponding subtraction statement is 9 – 5 = 4.
(Remember: Target Number – Starting Number = Movement
needed)

Using the unmarked number line to add and subtract
Just as you can do additions, subtractions and comparisons with small
numbers using the number line above, you can also do them with
large numbers by imagining an ‘infinite number line’ or drawing an
‘unmarked number line’ as follows:
0

This line shows only the position of zero. Other numbers are not
marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to
add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale
of the number line and the positions of numbers on it.
For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the
addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ?
– 60

0

+25

+85

We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25
The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can also be
written as a missing addend problem: (– 100) – (+ 250) = ? or 250 + ? = – 100.
?

– 100

0

+ 250

We can then visualise that ? = –350 in this problem.
In this way, you can carry out addition and subtraction problems,
with positive and negative numbers, on paper or in your head using an
unmarked number line.

Converting subtraction to addition and addition to subtraction
Recall that Target Floor – Starting Floor = Movement needed
or
Target Floor = Starting Floor + Movement needed
If we start at 2 and wish to go to – 3, what is the movement needed?
First method: Looking at the number line, we see we need to
move – 5 (i.e., 5 in the backward direction). Therefore, – 3 – 2 = – 5.
The movement needed is –5.
Second method: Break the journey from 2 to –3 into two parts.
a. From 2 to 0, the movement is 0 – 2 = – 2.
b. From 0 to –3, the movement is – 3 – 0 = – 3.
The total movement is the sum of the two movements: – 3 + (– 2) = – 5.
Look at the two coloured expressions. There is no subtraction in
the second one!
In this way, we can always convert subtraction to addition. The
number that is being subtracted can be replaced by its inverse
and then added instead.
Similarly, a number that is being added can be replaced by
its inverse and then subtracted. In this way, we can also always
convert addition to subtraction.
Examples:
a. (+ 7) – (+ 5) = (+ 7) + (– 5)
b. (– 3) – (+ 8) = (– 3) + (– 8)
c. (+ 8) – (– 2) = (+ 8) + (+ 2)
d. (+ 6) – (– 9) = (+ 6) + (+ 9)

10.2 The Token Model
Using tokens for addition
In Bela’s Building of Fun, the lift attendant is bored. To entertain
himself, he keeps a box containing lots of positive (red) and negative
(black) tokens. Each time he presses the ‘+’ button, he takes a
positive token from the box and puts it in his pocket. Similarly,
each time he presses the ‘–’ button, he takes a negative token and
puts it in his pocket.
He starts on the ground floor (Floor 0) with an empty pocket. After
one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative
tokens. On which floor is he now?
He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2.
So, he is at Floor + 2 now.
Here is another way to do the calculation.

A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because
the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in
his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively,
and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative
token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are
left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2.
We can perform any such addition using tokens!
Example: Add + 5 and – 8.

From the picture, we see that we can remove five zero pairs, and we
are then left with – 3. Therefore (+ 5) + (– 8) = – 3.

Using tokens for subtraction
We have seen how to perform addition of integers with positive
tokens and negative tokens. We can also perform subtraction using
tokens!
Example: Let us subtract:
(+5) – (+4).
This is easy to do. From 5 positives
take away 4 positives to see the result.

(+ 5) – (+ 4) = + 1

Example: Let us subtract:
(–7) – (–5).
Is (– 7) – (– 5) the same as (– 7) + (+ 5)?

(–7) – (–5) = –2

Example: Let us subtract: (+ 5) – (+ 6).
Put down 5 positives.
But there are not enough tokens to take out 6 positives!

To get around this issue, we can put out an extra zero pair (a
positive and a negative), knowing that this does not change the value
of the set of tokens.
Now, we can take out 6 positives!
See what is left:
We conclude that (+5) – (+6) = – 1.
Figure it Out
1.

Evaluate the following differences using tokens. Check that you
get the same result as with other methods you now know:
a. (+ 10) – (+ 7)
b. (– 8) – (– 4)
c. (– 9) – (– 4)

d. (+ 9) – (+ 12)
e. (– 5) – (– 7)
2. Complete the subtractions:
a. (– 5) – (– 7)
b. (+ 10) – (+ 13)
d. (+ 3) – (+ 8)
e. (– 2) – (– 7)

f. (– 2) – (– 6)
c. (– 7) – (– 9)
f. (+ 3) – (+ 15)

Example: + 4 – (– 6).
Start with 4 positives.
We have to take out 6 negatives from these. But there are not
enough negatives.
This is not a problem. We add some zero pairs as this does not
change the value of the set of tokens.
But how many zero pairs? We have to take away 6 negatives so
we put down 6 zero pairs:

Now we can take away 6 negatives:

Therefore, + 4 – (– 6) = + 10.

10.3 Integers in Other Places
Credits and debits
Suppose you open a bank account at your local bank with the `100
that you had been saving over the last month. Your bank balance
therefore, starts at `100.
Then you make `60 at your job the next day and you deposit it in
your account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘credit’.
Your new bank balance is _______.
	The next day you pay your electric bill of `30 using your bank
account. This is shown in your bank passbook as a ‘debit’.
Your bank balance is now ______.
	The next day you make a major purchase for your business of
`150. Again this is shown as a debit.
What is your bank balance now? ______
Is this possible?
Yes, some banks do allow your account balance to become negative,
temporarily! Some banks also charge you an additional amount if
your balance becomes negative, in the form of ‘interest’ or a ‘fee’.
Your strategic large purchase the previous day allows you to
make, `200 at your business the next day.

What is your balance now? ______
You can think of ‘credits’ as positive numbers and ‘debits’ as negative
numbers. The total of all your credits (positive numbers) and debits
(negative numbers) is your total bank account balance. This can be
positive or negative!
In general, it is better to try to keep a positive balance in your
bank account!

Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you
have credits of `30, `40, and `50, and debits of `40, `50, and `60.
What is your bank account balance now?
Suppose you start with `0 in your bank account, and then you have
debits of `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, and then a single credit of
`256. What is your bank account balance now?
Why is it generally better to try and maintain a positive balance in
your bank account? What are circumstances under which it may
be worthwhile to temporarily have a negative balance?

As you can see, positive and negative numbers along with zero are
extremely useful in the world of banking and accounting.

Geographical cross sections
We measure the height of geographical features like mountains,
plateaus, and deserts from ‘sea level’. The height at sea level is 0m.
Heights above sea level are represented using positive numbers and
heights below sea level are represented using negative numbers.

10.5 A Pinch of History
Like general fractions, general integers (including zero and the
negative numbers) were first conceived of and used in Asia, thousands
of years ago, before they eventually spread across the world in more
modern times.
The first known instances of the use of negative numbers
occurred in the context of accounting. In one of China’s most
important mathematical works, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical
Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu)—which was completed by the first or second
century CE—positive and negative numbers were represented using
red and black rods, much like the way we represented them using
red and black tokens!

266

Chapter 10_The Other Side of Zero.indd 266

13-08-2024 17:32:41

The Other Side of Zero

There was a strong culture of accountancy also in India in ancient
times. The concept of credit and debit was written about extensively
by Kautilya in his Arthaśhāstra (c. 300 BCE), including the recognition
that an account balance could be negative. The explicit use of negative
numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient
Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the
year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special
symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as
we do today).
The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers,
and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on
which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in
his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave
clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive,
negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of
understanding these numbers that we still use today!
Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of
positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below:
Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta
18.30, 628 CE)
1.
2.

3.

4.
5.

The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).
The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add
the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to
obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5).
To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to
obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2, 2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2).
The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).
The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0
= – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0).

2.

4.
5.

If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result
is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1).
If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result
is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1).
Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the
corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3).
Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 –
(– 2) = 0).
Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2
– 0 = – 2 and 0 – 0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the
number’s inverse (e.g., 0 – (– 2) = 2).

Once you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition
and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative,
and zero!

Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s
Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line?
Give your own examples of each rule.

Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on
an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative
numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic
operations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming
what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does
mathematics.
However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to
adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers
were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab
world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the
13th century.

The Other Side of Zero

Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many
European mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a
French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers
‘absurd’. But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved
to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are
now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with
and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had
recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE!
This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way
for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about
in future classes.

Summary
 There are numbers that are less than zero. They are written with a ‘–’
sign in front of them (e.g., – 2), and are called negative numbers. They
lie to the left of zero on the number line.
 The numbers ..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called integers. The
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers and the numbers …,
– 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive
nor negative.
 Every given number has another number associated to it which when
added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive
inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and
the additive inverse of – 543 is 543.
 Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target
Position.
 Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or
increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement.
 Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position
= Movement.

 In general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules
for Addition:
a. If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a
positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).
b. If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs),
and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5).
c. If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the
smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number
(without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to
obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2).
d. A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0).
e. A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2).
 We can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition
problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an
integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse.
 Integers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller
numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line.
 We can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting
them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers
as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly,
negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground
level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive
temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative
temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.

but need not decide or fix this before or during play.
• Each player rolls two dice at a time. One dice has numbers
from + 1 to + 6 and the other dice has numbers from – 1 to – 6.
• After each roll of the two dice, the player can add or subtract
them in any order and then move the steps that indicate the
result. A positive result means moving towards + 50 and a
negative result means moving towards – 50.
