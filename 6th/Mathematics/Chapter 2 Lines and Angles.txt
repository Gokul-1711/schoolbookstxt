Lines and Angles

In this chapter, we will explore some of the most basic ideas of
geometry including points, lines, rays, line segments and angles.
These ideas form the building blocks of ‘plane geometry’, and will
help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as
the construction and analysis of different shapes.

2.1 Point
Mark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil. The sharper the
tip, the thinner will be the dot. This tiny dot will give you an idea of
a point. A point determines a precise location, but it has no length,
breadth or height. Some models for a point are given below.

The tip of a
compass

The sharpened
end of a pencil

The pointed
end of a needle

If you mark three points on a piece of paper,
you may be required to distinguish these three
points. For this purpose, each of the three points
may be denoted by a single capital letter such as

P

T

Z, P and T. These points are read as ‘Point Z’, ‘Point P’ and ‘Point T’. Of
course, the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be
invisibly thin.

2.2 Line Segment
Fold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you
see a crease? This gives the idea of a line
segment. It has two end points, A and B.
Mark any two points A and B on a sheet of
paper. Try to connect A to B by various
routes (Fig. 2.1).
What is the shortest route from A to B?
This shortest path from point A to Point B
(including A and B) as shown here is called
the line segment from A to B. It is denoted by
either AB or BA. The points A and B are called
the end points of the line segment AB.

Imagine that the line segment from A to B (i.e.,
B

beyond B in the other direction without any
end (see Fig. 2.2). This is a model for a line. Do
A
you think you can draw a complete picture of
Fig. 2.2
a line? No. Why?
A line through two points A and B is written as AB . It extends
forever in both directions. Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like
l or m.
Observe that any two points determine a unique line that passes
through both of them.

2.4 Ray
A ray is a portion of a line that starts at one point (called the starting
point or initial point of the ray) and goes on endlessly in a direction.
The following are some models for a ray:

lighthouse

Ray of light from a torch

Sun rays

Look at the diagram (Fig. 2.3) of a ray. Two points are
marked on it. One is the starting point A and the other
is a point P on the path of the ray. We then denote the
ray by AP.

ar
An angle is formed by two rays having a
common starting point. Here is an angle
B
formed by rays BD and BE where B is vertex
arm
the common starting point (Fig. 2.8).
The point B is called the vertex of the
E
angle, and the rays BD and BE are called
Fig. 2.8
the arms of the angle. How can we name
this angle? We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B.
To be clearer, we use a point on each of the arms together with the
vertex to name the angle. In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE
or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e.,
∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always
written as the middle letter.
To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer
to Fig. 2.9).
Vidya has just opened her book. Let us observe her opening the
cover of the book in different scenarios.

Do you see angles being made in each of these cases? Can you mark
their arms and vertex?
Which angle is greater—the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2?
Just as we talk about the size of a line based on its length, we also
talk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation.
So, the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate
the cover more. Similarly, the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that
of Case 2, because there is even more rotation, and Cases 4, 5, and 6
are successively larger angles with more and more rotation.
The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed
about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray.

Let’s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life
by rotation or turn:

• In a compass or divider, we turn the arms to form
an angle. The vertex is the point where the two
arms are joined. Identify the arms and vertex of
the angle.

• A pair of scissors has two blades. When we open

them (or ‘turn them’) to cut something, the blades
form an angle. Identify the arms and the vertex of
the angle.

• Look at the pictures of spectacles, wallet and other common
objects. Identify the angles in them by marking out their arms
and vertices.

Do you see how these angles are formed by turning one arm with
respect to the other?

2.6 Comparing Angles
Look at these animals opening their mouths. Do you see any angles
here? If yes, mark the arms and vertex of each one. Some mouths are
open wider than others; the more the turning of the jaws, the larger
the angle! Can you arrange the angles in this picture from smallest to
largest?

Comparing angles by superimposition
Any two angles can be compared by placing them one over the other,
i.e., by superimposition. While superimposing, the vertices of the
angles must overlap.
After superimposition, it becomes clear which angle is smaller
and which is larger.

The corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with
each other, i.e., OA ↔ OX and OB ↔ OY. So, the angles are equal in size.
The reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is
because when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out
of rotation, we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation
needed to move OB to OA and OY to OX .
From the point of view of superimposition, when two angles
are superimposed, and the common vertex and the two rays of
both angles lie on top of each other, then the sizes of the angles
are equal.

Comparing angles without superimposition
Two cranes are arguing
about who can open their
mouth wider, i.e., who is
making a bigger angle.
Let us first draw their
angles. How do we know
which one is bigger? As seen

before, one could trace these angles, superimpose them and then
check. But can we do it without superimposition?
Suppose we have a transparent circle which can be moved and
placed on figures. Can we use this for comparison?
Let us place the circular paper on the angle made by the first
crane. The circle is placed in such a way that its centre is on the
vertex of the angle. Let us mark the points A and B on the edge circle
at the points where the arms of the angle pass through the circle.

If you can make a circular piece of transparent paper, try this method
to compare the angles in Fig. 2.10 with each other.
Teacher’s Note
A teacher needs to check the understanding of the students around
the notion of an angle. Sometimes students might think that
increasing the length of the arms of the angle increases the angle.
For this, various situations should be posed to the students to check
their understanding on the same.

2.7 Making Rotating Arms
Let us make ‘rotating arms’ using two paper straws and a paper clip
by following these steps:
1. Take two paper straws and a paper clip. 

2. Insert the straws into the arms of the paper
clip.

3. Your rotating arm is ready!
Make several ‘rotating arms’ with different angles between the
arms. Arrange the angles you have made from smallest to largest by
comparing and using superimposition.
Passing through a slit: Collect a number of rotating arms with different
angles; do not rotate any of the rotating arms during this activity.

25

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd 25

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Take a cardboard and make an angle-shaped slit as shown below
by tracing and cutting out the shape of one of the rotating arms.

Now, shuffle and mix up all the rotating arms. Can you identify
which of the rotating arms will pass through the slit?
The correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms
over the slit. Let us do this for some of the rotating arms:

Slit angle is greater than
the arms’ angle. The arms
will not go through the
slit.

Slit angle is less than the
arms’ angle. The arms
will not go through the
slit.

Slit angle is equal to the
arms’ angle. The arms will
go through the slit.

Only the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the
slit passes through the slit. Note that the possibility of passing through
the slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not
on their lengths (as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit).

2.8 Special Types of Angles
Let us go back to Vidya’s
notebook and observe her
opening the cover of the book
in different scenarios.
She makes a full turn of the
cover when she has to write
while holding the book in
her hand.
She makes a half turn of the
cover when she has to open
it on her table. In this case,
observe the arms of the angle formed. They lie in a straight line.
Such an angle is called a straight angle.

Let us consider a straight angle ∠AOB. Observe that any ray OC
divides it into two angles, ∠AOC and ∠COB.

equal to each other in size?

Math
Talk

Let’s Explore
We can try to solve this problem using a piece of paper. Recall that when
a fold is made, it creates a crease which is straight.
Take a rectangular piece of paper and on one of its sides, mark
the straight angle AOB. By folding, try to get a line (crease) passing
through O that divides ∠AOB into two equal angles.
How can it be done?

Fold the paper such that OB overlaps with OA. Observe the crease
and the two angles formed.

28

13-08-2024 16:14:33

Lines and Angles

Justify why the two angles are equal. Is there a way to
superimpose and check? Can this superimposition be done by
folding?
Each of these equal angles formed are called right angles. So, a
straight angle contains two right angles.

Why shouldn't you
argue with a 90 ̊
angle?

Because they're
always right.

If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn, how much of a
full turn will form a right angle? 
Observe that a right angle resembles the shape of an ‘L’. An angle
is a right angle only if it is exactly half of a straight angle. Two lines
that meet at right angles are called perpendicular lines.

Classifying Angles
Angles are classified in three groups as shown below. Right angles
are shown in the second group. What could be the common feature
of the other two groups?

In the first group, all angles are less than a right angle or in other
words, less than a quarter turn. Such angles are called acute angles.
In the third group, all angles are greater than a right angle but
less than a straight angle. The turning is more than a quarter turn
and less than a half turn. Such angles are called obtuse angles.

2.9 Measuring Angles
We have seen how to compare two angles. But can we actually
quantify how big an angle is using a number without having to
compare it to another angle?
We saw how various angles can be compared using a circle.
Perhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles?

Fig. 2.12

To assign precise measures to angles, mathematicians came up
with an idea. They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into

32

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd 32

13-08-2024 16:14:34

Lines and Angles

360 equal angles or parts. The angle measure of each of these unit
parts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°.
This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure
of an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it.
For example, see this figure:

30 units

It contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30°.
Measures of different angles: What is the measure of a full turn in
degrees? As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees, its measure is 360°.
What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees? A straight
angle is half of a full turn. As a full-turn is 360°, a half turn is 180°.
What is the measure of a right angle in degrees? Two right angles
together form a straight angle. As a straight angle measures 180°, a
right angle measures 90°.

A pinch of history

we use 360° today is not fully known. The division of a circle into

33

Chapter 2_Lines and Angles.indd 33

14-08-2024 14:20:43

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very
oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of
a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars,
also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia,
Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In
addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60
and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s.
Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why
mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360
degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided
by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the
circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole
number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible
by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of
hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.
The circle has been divided into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 10 and 12 parts
below. What are the degree measures of the resulting angles? Write
the degree measures down near the indicated angles.

Degree measures of different angles
How can we measure other angles in degrees? It is for this purpose
that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided
into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig. 2.12 (on page 32), or a half
circle divided into 180 equal parts.

Unlabelled protractor
Here is a protractor. Do you see the straight angle at the center
divided into 180 units of 1
degree? Only part of the
lines dividing the straight
angle are visible, though!
Starting
from
the
marking on the rightmost
point of the base, there
is a long mark for every
10°. From every such long
mark, there is a medium
sized mark after 5°.

a. ∠ KAL
Notice that the vertex of this

units of 1 degree angle between KA
and AL gives the measure of ∠KAL.
By counting, we get —
			
∠KAL = 30°

and large sized marks, is it possible
to count the number of units in 5s

What is the degree measure of ∠AOB?
Make your own Protractor!
You may have wondered how the different equally spaced markings are
made on a protractor. We will now see how we can make some of them!
1.	Draw a circle of a convenient radius on a sheet of paper. Cut out
the circle (Fig. 2.13). A circle or one full turn is 360°.
2.	Fold the circle to get two equal halves and cut it through the
crease to get a semicircle. Write ‘0°’ in the bottom right corner of
the semicircle.

∠GOH = ∠HOI=_____. Why?

Angle Bisector
At each step, we folded in halves. This process of getting half of a
given angle is called bisecting the angle. The line that bisects a given
angle is called the angle bisector of the angle.
Identify the angle bisectors in your handmade protractor. Try to make
different angles using the concept of angle bisector through paper folding.

students can appreciate the practical applications of angles in real-life
situations, e.g., clocks, doors, swings, concepts of uphill and downhill,
location of the sun, the giving of directions, etc.

Let’s Play a Game #1
This is an angle guessing game! Play this game with your classmates
by making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here are the instructions
and rules for the game:

• Team 1 secretly choose an angle measure, for example, 49° and

makes an angle with that measure using a protractor without
Team 2 being able to see it.

• Team 2 now gets to look at the angle. They have to quickly
discuss and guess the number of degrees in the angle (without
using a protractor!).

• Team 1 now demonstrates the true measure of the angle with
a protractor.

• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute

difference in degrees between their guess and the correct
measure. For example, if Team 2 guesses 39°, then they score
10 points (49°–39°).

• Each team gets five turns. The winner is the team with the
lowest score!

Let’s Play a Game #2
We now change the rules of the game a bit. Play this game with your
classmates by again making two teams, Team 1 and Team 2. Here
are the instructions and rules:

• Team 1 announces to all, an angle measure, e.g., 34°.
• A player from Team 2 must draw that angle on the board without

using a protractor. Other members of Team 2 can help the player
by speaking words like ‘Make it bigger!’ or ‘Make it smaller!’.

• A player from Team 1 measures the angle with a protractor
for all to see.

• Team 2 scores the number of points that is the absolute
difference in degrees between Team 2’s angle size and the
intended angle size. For example, if player’s angle from Team 2
is measured to be 25°, then Team 2 scores 9 points (34°–25°).

• Each team gets five turns. The winner is again the team with the
lowest score.

Teacher’s Note

These games are important to play to build intuition about angles
and their measures. Return to this game at least once or twice on
different days to build practice in estimating angles. Note that
these games can also be played between pairs of students.

We have read about different types of angles in this chapter. We
have seen that a straight angle is 180° and a right angle is 90°. How
can other types of angles — acute and obtuse — be described in terms
of their degree measures?
Acute Angle: Angles that are smaller than the right angle, i.e., less
than 90° and are greater than 0°, are called acute angles.

Summary


A point determines a location. It is denoted by a capital letter.



A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two
points. The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST.



A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both
sides indefinitely; it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small
letter like m.



A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction
indefinitely. It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray.



An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting
point. Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM (also called ∠MOP);
here, O is called the vertex of the angle, and the rays OP and OM are
called the arms of the angle.



The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the
vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle.



The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees. One full rotation or
turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360°.



Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor.



Angles can be straight (180°), right (90°), acute (more than 0° and less
than 90°), obtuse (more than 90° and less than 180°), and reflex (more
than 180° and less than 360°).
