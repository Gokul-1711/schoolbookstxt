Data Handling and
Presentation
If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will
get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you
measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a
collection of measures of weight—again data.
Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other
descriptions of things that convey information about those things is
called data.
We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts
of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter,
we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we
can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make
inferences from such data!

4.1 Collecting and Organising Data

Data Handling and Presentation

To figure out the most popular game in
their class, what should Navya and Naresh
do? Can you help them?

Naresh and Navya decided to go to each student in the class and
ask what their favourite game is. Then they prepared a list.
Navya is showing the list:
Mehnoor – Kabaddi

Pushkal – Satoliya (Pittu)

Anaya – Kabaddi

Jubimon – Hockey

Densy – Badminton

Jivisha – Satoliya (Pittu)

Simran – Kabaddi

Jivika – Satoliya (Pittu)

Rajesh – Football

Nand – Satoliya (Pittu) Leela – Hockey

Thara – Football

Ankita – Kabaddi

Afshan – Hockey

Soumya – Cricket

Rehana – Hockey

Arsh – Kabaddi

Debabrata – Football

Aarna – Badminton

Bhavya – Cricket

Ananya – Hockey

Kompal – Football

Sarah – Kabaddi

Hardik – Cricket

Tahira – Cricket

She says (happily), “I have collected the data. I can figure out the
most popular game now!”.
A few other children are looking at the list and wondering, “We
can’t yet see the most popular game. How can we get it from this list?”.

Shri Nilesh is a teacher. He decided to bring sweets to the class
to celebrate the new year. The sweets shop nearby has jalebi, gulab
jamun, gujiya, barfi, and rasgulla. He wanted to know the choices of
the children. He wrote the names of the sweets on the board and
asked each child to tell him their preference. He put a tally mark
‘|’ for each student and when the count reached 5, he put a line
through the previous four and marked it as ||||.

Shri Nilesh requested one of the staff members to bring the sweets as
given in the table. The above table helped him to purchase the correct
numbers of sweets.
2.	Is the above table sufficient to distribute each type of sweet to
the correct student? Explain. If it is not sufficient, what is the
alternative?
To organise the data, we can write the name of each sweet in one
column and using tally signs, note the number of students who prefer
that sweet. The numbers 6, 9, … are the frequencies of the sweet
preferences for jalebi, gulab jamun … respectively.

Teacher’s Note
Provide more opportunities to collect and organise data. Ask students
to guess what is the most popular colour, game, toy, school subject, etc.,
amongst the students in their classroom and then collect the data for it.
It can be a fun activity in which they also learn about their classmates.
Discuss how they can organise the data in different ways, each way
having its own advantages and limitations. For all these tasks and the
tasks under ‘Figure it Out’, discuss the tasks with the children and let
them understand the tasks, and then let them plan and present their
research processes and conclusions in the class.

4.2 Pictographs
Pictographs are one visual and suggestive way to represent data
without writing any numbers. Look at this picture — you may be
familiar with it from previous classes.
Modes of Travelling

This picture helps you understand at a glance the different
modes of travel used by students. Based on this picture, answer the
following questions:

•• Which mode of travel is used by the most number of students?
•• Which mode of travel is used by the least number of students?

A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps
answer questions about data with just a quick glance.
In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent
one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or
symbol stands for many people or objects.
Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of
his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least
9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data:
Response

Number of Children (

= 10 Children)

Always

Answer the following questions using the pictograph:
1.

 hat is the number of children who always slept at least 9

•• Pictographs are a nice visual and suggestive way to represent
data. They represent data through pictures of objects.

•• Pictographs can help answer questions and make inferences
about data with just a quick glance (in the examples above—
about favourite games, favourite colours, most common modes
of conveyance, number of students absent, etc.).

By reading a pictograph, we can quickly understand the
•• 
frequencies of the different categories (for example, cricket,
hockey, etc.) and the comparisons of these frequencies.

•• In a pictograph, the categories can be arranged horizontlly or
vertically. For each category, simple pictures and symbols are
then drawn in the designated columns or rows according to the
frequency of that category.

•• A scale or key (for example,

: 1 student or
: 5 students)
is added to show what each symbol or picture represents. Each
symbol or picture can represent one unit or multiple units.

•• It can be more challenging to prepare a pictograph when the
amount of data is large or when the frequencies are not exact
multiples of the scale or key.

Like pictographs, such
bar graphs can help us to

interpret
information,
such as the highest value,
the comparison of values
of different categories, etc.

length or height of each bar represents the given number. As we saw in
pictographs, we can use a scale or key when the frequencies are larger.
Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing
in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day.
The number of vehicles passing through the crossing each hour from
6 a.m. to 12:00 noon is shown in the bar graph. One unit of length
stands for 100 vehicles.

We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown
by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph
shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time.
The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles
passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown
by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During
that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The
second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon,
when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.
The total number of cars passing through the crossing during the
two-hour interval 8.00–10.00 a.m. as shown by the bar graph is about
1000 + 800 = 1800 vehicles.

to take 1 unit length to represent one person, drawing the bars will

be difficult! Therefore, we choose the scale so that 1 unit represents
10 crores. The bar graph for this choice is shown in the figure. So a
bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents
80 crores.

•• On the basis of this bar graph, what may be a few questions you
may ask your friends?

•• How much did the population of India increase over 50 years?
How much did the population increase in each decade?

4.4 Drawing a Bar Graph
In a previous example, Shri Nilesh prepared a frequency table
representing the sweet preferences of the students in his class. Let’s
try to prepare a bar graph to present his data —
1.

 irst, we draw a horizontal
F

line and a vertical line. On
Jalebi

the horizontal line, we will
Gulab jamun

write the name of each of
the sweets, equally spaced,
Gujiya
13
from which the bars will
Barfi
3
rise in accordance with
Rasgulla
7
their frequencies; and on
the vertical line we will write the frequencies representing the
number of students.

2.

We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many
students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that
it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to
represent 1 student.

3.

For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6
units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly
for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their
frequencies.

89

Chapter 4_Data Handling and Presentation.indd 89

13/08/2024 15:33:14

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

We, therefore, get a bar graph as shown below —

When the frequencies are larger and we cannot use the scale of
1 unit length = 1 number (frequency), we need to choose a different
scale like we did in the case of pictographs.
Example: The number of runs scored by Smriti in each of the
8 matches are given in the table below:
Match

In this example, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score
is 100. Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we
have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would
be unnecessarily tedious. Instead, let us use a scale where 1 unit
length = 10 runs. We mark this scale on the vertical line and draw
the bars according to the scores in each match. We get the following
bar graph representing the above data.

To represent this data in the form of a bar graph, here are the steps —

•• Draw two perpendicular lines, one horizontal and one vertical.
•• Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ with equal spacing

between them and mark the corresponding expenditures along
the vertical line.

91

•• Take bars of the same width, keeping a uniform gap between them.
•• Choose a suitable scale along the vertical line. Let, 1 unit length =
` 200, and then mark and write the corresponding values (` 200,
` 400, etc.) representing each unit length.

Finally, calculate the heights of the bars for various items as
shown below —

•	Like pictographs, bar graphs give a nice visual way to represent
data. They represent data through equally-spaced bars, each of
equal width, where the lengths or heights give frequencies of the
different categories.
•	Each category is represented by a bar where the length or height
depicts the corresponding frequency (for example, cost) or
quantity (for example, runs).
•	The bars have uniform spaces between them to indicate that they
are free standing and represent equal categories.
•	The bars help in interpreting data much faster than a frequency
table. By reading a bar graph, we can compare frequencies of
different categories at a glance.
•	We must decide the scale (for example, 1 unit length = 1 student
or 1 unit length = ` 200) for a bar graph on the basis of the data
including the minimum and maximum frequencies, so that the
resulting bar graph fits nicely and looks visually appealing on the
paper or poster we are preparing. The markings of the unit lengths
as per the scale must start from zero.

Teacher’s Note

The main focus of this chapter is to learn how to handle data to find
answers to specific questions or inquiries, to test hypotheses or to
take specific decisions. This should be kept in mind when providing
practice opportunities to collect, organise and analyse data.

4.5 Artistic and Aesthetic Considerations
In addition to the steps described in previous sections, there are
also some other more artistic and aesthetic aspects one can consider
when preparing visual presentations of data to make them more
interesting and effective. First, when making a visual presentation
of data such as a pictograph or bar graph, it is important to make
it fit in the intended space; this can be controlled, for example, by
choosing the scale appropriately, as we have seen earlier. It is also
desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and
easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the
information being conveyed.
Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest
mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain
in meters.

5642m

How much taller is Mount Everest than Mount Koscuiszko? Are
Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This
is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers.
As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers
into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn
as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the
number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights
of all these mountains at a glance.

However, since the boxes represent heights, it is better and more
visually appealing to rotate the picture, so that the boxes grow
upward, vertically from the ground like mountains. A bar graph
with vertical bars is also called a column graph. Columns are the
pillars you find in a building that hold up the roof.
Below is a column graph for our table of tallest mountains. From
this column graph, it becomes easier to compare and visualise the
heights of the mountains.

Data Handling and Presentation

In general, it is more intuitive, suggestive and visually appealing
to represent heights, that are measured upwards from the ground,
using bar graphs that have vertical bars or columns. Similarly,
lengths that are parallel to the ground (for example, distances
between location on Earth) are usually best represented using bar
graphs with horizontal arcs.
Figure it Out
1.

If you wanted to visually represent the data of the heights of the
tallest persons in each class in your school, would you use a graph
with vertical bars or horizontal bars? Why?

2.

If you were making a table of the longest rivers on each continent
and their lengths, would you prefer to use a bar graph with
vertical bars or with horizontal bars? Why? Try finding out this
information, and then make the corresponding table and bar
graph! Which continents have the longest rivers?

Infographics
When data visualisations such as bar graphs are further beautified
with more extensive artistic and visual imagery, they are called
information graphics or infographics for short. The aim of
infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging
visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly,
in a visually pleasing way.
As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate
data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing
the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with
vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more
indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use
triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a
splash of colour as well. Here is the result.

While this infographic might look more appealing and suggestive at
first glance, it does have some issues. The goal of our bar graph earlier
was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the
appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the
same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights.
However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are
taller mountains always wider? The infographic is implying additional
information that may be misleading and may or may not be correct.
Sometimes going for more appealing pictures can also accidentally
mislead.
Taking this idea further, and to make the picture even more visually
stimulating and suggestive, we can further change the shapes of the
mountains to make them look even more like mountains, and add
other details, while attempting to preserve the heights. For example,
we can create an imaginary mountain range that contains all these
mountains.
Is the infographic below better than the column graph with
rectangular columns of equal width? The mountains look more
realistic, but is the picture accurate?
For example, Everest appears to be twice as tall as Elbrus.

What is 5642 × 2?
While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we
also need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us
about the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making
or reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended
audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled.

Summary






Facts, numbers, measures, observations and other descriptions of
things that convey information about those things is called data.
Data can be organised in a tabular form using tally marks for easy
analysis and interpretation.
Frequencies are the counts of the occurrences of values, measures or
observations.

Pictographs represent data in the form of pictures, or objects or parts
of objects. Each picture represents a frequency which can be 1 or more
than 1 — this is called the scale and it must be specified.
Bar graphs have bars of uniform width; the length or height that
indicates the total frequency of occurrence. The scale that is used to
convert length or height to frequency again, must be specified.
Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is
important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information
or data and to also make it visually appealing.
Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual
appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures
are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These
aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling
and presentation.
However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also
sometimes be misleading.
By reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly
understand and make inferences about the data presented.
