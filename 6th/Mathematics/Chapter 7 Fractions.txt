Fractions
Recall that when some whole number of things are shared
equally among some number of people, fractions tell us how
much each share is.
Shabnam:	Do you remember, if one roti is divided equally
between two children, how much
roti will each child get?
Mukta:

Each child will get half a roti.

Shabnam:	The fraction ‘one half’ is written as
1 . We also sometimes read this as
2

‘one upon two.’

Mukta:	If one roti is equally shared among
4 children, how much roti will one child get?
Shabnam: Each child’s share is 14 roti.

Mukta:

And which is more 12 roti or 14 roti?

Shabnam: When 2 children share 1 roti
equally, each child gets 12 roti. When

4 children share 1 roti equally, each
child gets 14 roti. Since, in the second

group more children share the

same one roti, each child gets a smaller share. So, 12 roti is

more than 14 roti.

7.1 Fractional Units and Equal Shares
Beni:

Which fraction is greater — 15 or 19?

Beni:

9 is bigger than 5. So I would guess that 19 is greater
than 15 . Am I right?
No! That is a common mistake. Think of these fractions
as shares.
If one roti is shared among 5 children, each one gets a
share of 15 roti. If one roti is shared among 9 children,
each one gets a share of 19 roti?
Exactly! Now think again - which share is higher?

Arvin:
Beni:

If I share with more people, I will get less. So, 19 < 15 .
You got it!

Arvin:
Beni:
Arvin:

When one unit is divided into several equal parts, each part is
called a fractional unit. These are all fractional units:

Knowledge from the past!
Fractions have been used and named in India since ancient times.
In the Rig Veda, the fraction 3 is referred to as tri-pada. This has the
4
same meaning as the words for 3 in many Indian languages today,
4
e.g., ʻteen paavʼ in colloquial Hindi and ‘mukkaal’ in Tamil. Indeed,
words for fractions used today in many Indian languages go back to
ancient times.
Find out and discuss the words for fractions that are used in the different
languages spoken in your home, city, or state. Ask your grandparents,
parents, teachers, and classmates what words they use for different
fractions, such as for one and a half, three quarters, one and a quarter, half,
quarter, and two and a half, and write them here:

Reading Fractions
We usually read the fraction 34 as ‘three quarters’ or ‘three upon four’,
1

but reading it as ‘3 times 4 ’ helps us to understand the size of the

fraction because it clearly shows what the fractional unit is ( 14 ) and
how many such fractional units (3) there are.
Recall what we call the top number and the bottom number of fractions.
In the fraction 5 , 5 is the numerator and 6 is the denominator.

7.5 Mixed Fractions
Fractions greater than one

You marked some fractions on the number line earlier. Did you
notice that the lengths of all the blue lines were less than one and
the lengths of all the black lines were more than 1?
Write down all the fractions you marked on the number line
earlier.
Now, let us classify these in two groups:
Lengths less than 1 unit

Lengths more than 1 unit

Did you notice something common between the fractions that
are greater than 1?
In all the fractions that are less than 1 unit, the numerator is
smaller than the denominator, while in the fractions that are more
than 1 unit, the numerator is larger than the denominator.
We know that 32 , 52 and 72 are all greater than 1 unit. But can we
see how many whole units they contain?
3
= 12 + 12 + 12 = 1 + 12

= 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 2 + 12

Expressing a fraction in lowest terms (or in its simplest
form)
In any fraction, if its numerator and denominator have no common
factor except 1, then the fraction is said to be in lowest terms or in
its simplest form. In other words, a fraction is said to be in lowest
terms if its numerator and denominator are as small as possible.
Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an
equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small
as possible.
Let’s see how to express fractions in lowest terms.

We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are

4.

So, 16
20 ÷ 4 = 5

Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence, 16
20
expressed in lowest terms is 45 . So, 45 is called the simplest form of 16
,
20
since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.

Any fraction can be converted to
lowest terms by dividing both the
numerator and denominator by the
highest common factor between
them.

use 45 as a common
denominator.

This method of addition, which works for adding any number of
fractions, was first explicitly described in general by Brahmagupta
in the year 628 CE! We will describe the history of the development
of fractions in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we simply
summarise the steps in Brahmagupta’s method for addition of
fractions.
Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions
1. Find equivalent fractions so that the fractional unit is common
for all fractions. This can be done by finding a common multiple
of the denominators (e.g., the product of the denominators, or the
smallest common multiple of the denominators).
2. Add these equivalent fractions with the same fractional units.
This can be done by adding the numerators and keeping the same
denominator.
3. Express the result in lowest terms if needed.
Let us carry out another example of Brahmagupta’s method.
Example: Find the sum of 23 and 15 .
The denominators of the given fractions are 3 and 5. The lowest
common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Then we see that

7.9 A Pinch of History
Do you know what a fraction was called in ancient India? It was
called bhinna in Sanskrit, which means ‘broken’. It was also called
bhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’.
The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In
ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript
(from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 12 , they
wrote it as 12 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it

today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued
to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by
Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya
(c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line
segment between the numerator and denominator in ‘ 12 ’ and in other

Fractions

fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician
Al-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the
notation then spread to Europe and around the world.
Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient
Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only
fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More
general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now
called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional
1
units, e.g., 19
+ 16 + 18 , can be quite an art and leads to beautiful
24 = 2

puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below.
General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1)
were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even
division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulbasutras’ shows that even during Vedic times, Indians had discovered
the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures
for working with and computing with fractions were first codified
formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta.
Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with
fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta
described how to add and subtract fractions as follows:
“By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator
of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions
are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition,
the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added.
In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta,
Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE)
The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were
transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and
they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century
and then spread worldwide.

Puzzle!

	It is easy to add up fractional units to obtain the sum 1, if one
uses the same fractional unit, for example,
1
+ 12 = 1, 13 + 13 + 13 = 1, 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 1, etc.
2

		 However, can you think of a way to add fractional units that
are all different to get 1?
		 It is not possible to add two different fractional units to get 1.
The reason is that 12 is the largest fractional unit, and 12 + 12 = 1.
		 To get different fractional units, we would have to replace at
least one of the 12 ’s with some smaller fractional unit - but then

the sum would be less than 1! Therefore, it is not possible for
two different fractional units to add up to 1.
		 We can try to look instead for a way to write 1 as the sum of
three different fractional units.
1. Can you find three different fractional units that add
up to 1?

Try
This

	  I t turns out there is only one solution to this problem
(up to changing the order of the 3 fractions)! Can you
find it? Try to find it before reading further.
Here is a systematic way to find the solution. We know that
1 + 1 + 1 = 1. To get the
3
3
3

fractional units to be different, we will have

to increase at least one of the 13 ’s, and decrease at least one of the
other 13 ’s to compensate for that increase. The only way to increase

1 to another fractional unit is to replace it by 1 . So 1 must be one of
3
2
2

the fractional units.

Now 12 + 14 + 14 = 1. To get the fractional units to be different, we
1

will have to increase one of the 14 ’s and decrease the other 4 to

compensate for that increase. Now the only way to increase 14 to

184

Chapter 7_Fractions.indd 184

14-08-2024 15:06:07

Fractions

another fractional unit, that is different from 12 , is to replace it by 13 .

So two of the fractions must be 12 and 13 ! What must be third fraction

then, so that the three fractions add up to 1?

This explains why there is only one solution to the above problem.

you find at least one of them? Can you find them all?

Fraction as equal share: When a whole number of units is divided
into equal parts and shared equally, a fraction results.
Fractional Units: When one whole basic unit is divided into equal
parts, then each part is called a fractional unit.
Reading Fractions: In a fraction such as 5 , 5 is called the numerator
6

and 6 is called the denominator.
Mixed fractions contain a whole number part and a fractional part.
Number line: Fractions can be shown on a number line. Every fraction
has a point associated with it on the number line.
Equivalent Fractions: When two or more fractions represent the
same share or number, they are called equivalent fractions.
Lowest terms: A fraction whose numerator and denominator have
no common factor other than 1 is said to be in lowest terms or in its
simplest form.
Brahmagupta’s method for adding fractions: When adding fractions,
convert them into equivalent fractions with the same fractional unit
