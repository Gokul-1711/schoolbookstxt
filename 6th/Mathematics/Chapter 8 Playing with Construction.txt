Now, arm yourself with a ruler and a compass. Let us explore if
we can draw these figures with these tools and get familiar with a
compass.
Observe the way a compass is made. What can one draw with the
compass? Explore!
Do you know what curves are? They are any shapes that can be
drawn on paper with a pencil, and include straight lines, circles and
other figures as shown below:

Mark a point ‘P’ in your notebook. Then, mark as many points as
possible, in different directions, that are 4 cm away from P.
Think: Imagine marking all the points of 4 cm distance from the
point P. How would they look?

cm

Try to draw it and verify if it is correct by taking some points on
the curve and checking if their distances from P are indeed 4 cm.
Explore, if you have not already done so,
R
and see if a compass can be used for this
purpose.
You can start by marking a few points
of distance 4 cm from P using the compass.
How can this be done?

You will have to open up the compass against a ruler (see Fig. 8.2)
such that the distance between the tip of the compass and the pencil
is 4 cm.
	Now, try to get the full curve.
Hint: Keep the point of the compass fixed moving only the pencil.
What is the shape of the curve? It is a circle!
Take a point on the circle. What will be its distance from P— equal
to 4 cm, less than 4 cm or greater than 4 cm? Similarly, what will be
the distance between P and another point on the circle?
As shown in the figure, the point P is called the centre of the circle
and the distance between the centre and any point on the circle is
called the radius of the circle.

This figure has two components.

You might have figured out a way of drawing the first part. For
drawing the second part, see this.

The challenge here is to find out where to place the tip of the
compass and the radius to be taken for drawing this curve. You
can fix a radius in the compass and try placing the tip of the

boundary.

rectangles. But what makes them squares and rectangles?
Consider this rectangle ABCD.

The points A, B, C and D are the corners
of the rectangle. Lines AB, BC, CD and DA
are its sides. Its angles are ∠A, ∠B, ∠C
and ∠D.
The blue sides AB and CD are called

opposite sides, as they lie opposite to
each other. Likewise, AD and BC is the
other pair of opposite sides.

Playing with Constructions

Recall that, in a rectangle:
R1) The opposite sides are equal in length, and
R2) All the angles are 90°.
As in the case of rectangles, the corners and sides are defined for
a square in the same manner.
A square satisfies the following two properties:
S1) All the sides are equal, and
o
S2) All the angles are 90 .
See the rectangle in Fig. 8.4 and the name given to it: ABCD. This
rectangle can also be named in other ways — BCDA, CDAB, DABC,
ADCB, DCBA, CBAD and BADC. So, can a rectangle be named using
any combination of the labels around its corners? No! For example,
it cannot be named ABDC or ACBD. Can you see what names are
allowed and what names are not?
In a valid name, the corners occur in an order of travel around
the rectangle, starting from any corner.
Which of the following is not a name for this square?

Rotated Squares and Rectangles
Here is a square piece of paper
having all its sides equal in length
and all angles equal to 90°. It is
rotated as shown in the figure. Is it
still a square?
Let us check if the rotated paper
still satisfies the properties of a square.

•
•

Are all the sides still equal? Yes.
Are all the angles still 90°? Yes.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 6

Rotating a square does not change its
lengths and angles.
Therefore, this rotated figure satisfies both
the properties of a square and so, it is a square.
By the same reasoning, a rotated rectangle
is still a rectangle.
Figure it Out
1.

Draw the rectangle and four squares configuration (shown in
Fig. 8.3) on a dot paper.
What did you do to recreate this figure so that the four squares
are placed symmetrically around the rectangle? Discuss with
your classmates.

Draw at least 3 rotated squares and rectangles on a dot grid. Draw
them such that their corners are on the dots. Verify if the squares
and rectangles that you have drawn satisfy their respective
properties.

At which positions will the points X and Y be at their closest?
When do you think they will be the farthest? What does your
intuition say? Discuss with your classmates.

Math
Talk

Now, verify your guesses by placing the points X and Y on the
sides and measure how near or far they are.
The distance between X and Y can be obtained by measuring the
length of the line XY.
How does the minimum distance between the points X and Y
compare to the length of AB?
Change the positions of X and Y to check if there are other
positions where they are at their nearest or farthest. You could
construct multiple copies of the rectangle and try out various
positions of X and Y.
How will you keep track of the lengths XY for different positions
of X and Y?
Here is one way of doing it. Suppose here are some of the positions
of X and Y that you have considered:

•

When X is 5 mm away from A and Y is 3 cm away from B,
XY = ___ cm __ mm

•

When X is 1 cm away from A and Y is 1 cm away from B,
XY = ___ cm ___ mm

•

When X is 2 cm away from A and Y is 4 cm away from B,
XY = ___ cm ___ mm and so on.
Is there a shorthand way of writing it down? In all the sentences,
only the position of X, Y and the length XY changes. So we could
write this as:
Distance of X from A

Distance of Y from B

Length of XY

198

Have you checked what happens to the length XY when X and Y
are placed at the same distance away from A and B, respectively?
For example, as in the cases like these:

and so on.

How does the farthest distance between X and Y compare with
the length of AC? BD?

	What about constructing a rectangle that can be divided into
two identical squares? Can you try it?
I t is wise to first plan and then construct. But how do we plan?
Can you think of a way?

	One way is to visualise the final figure by drawing a rough
diagram of it.
A

B

C

F

D

What can we infer from this figure?
Can you identify the equal sides?
Since, the two squares are identical,
AB = BC and FE = ED
	Since ABEF and BCDE are squares, all the sides in each of the
squares are equal. This is written as —
AF = AB = BE = FE
BE = BC = CD = ED
So, all the shorter lines are equal!
	A convention is followed to represent equal sides. It is done by
putting a ‘|’ on the line. Refer to the rough figure.
	Using this analysis, can you try constructing it? Remember, all
that was asked for is a rectangle that can be divided into two
identical squares and with no measurements imposed.
	To draw the rectangle ACDF, one could assign any length to AF. For
example, if we assign AF = 4 cm, then what must the length of AC be?
Explore: Can the rectangle now be completed?
	In fact, one could proceed by drawing AF without even
measuring its length using a ruler. We could then construct a
line perpendicular to AF that is long enough to contain the other
side. As, AB = AF, we need to somehow transfer the length of AF

to get the point B. How do we do it without a ruler? Can it be
done using a compass?
Observe, how the length of AF is measured using a compass.

Use it to mark out the points B and C, and complete the rectangle.

rectangle marking the points as shown and measure the diagonals.
In rectangle PQRS, the right angles at P and R are referred to as
opposite angles. The other pair of opposite angles are the right
angles at Q and S.
Observe that a diagonal divides each of the pair of opposite
angles into two smaller angles. In the figure, the diagonal PR divides
angle R into two smaller angles which we simply call g and h. The
diagonal also divides angle P into c and d. Are g and h equal? Are
c and d equal?
First predict the answers, and then measure the angles. What do
you observe? Identify pairs of angles that are equal.
Explore
How should the rectangle be constructed so that the diagonal divides
the opposite angles into equal parts?
How will you record your observations? First, identify the
parameters that need to be tracked. They are the sides of the rectangle
and the 8 angles formed by the two diagonals. Are there any other
measurements that you would want to keep track of?

One of the ways of marking B is by taking a ruler and trying
to move it around to get a point on line l that is 7 cm from point D.
However, this requires trial and error. There is another efficient
method which doesn’t involve trial and error.
		
For this, instead of trying to get that one required point of distance
7 cm from D, let us explore a way of getting all the points of
distance 7 cm from D.

What is its distance from point D? If needed, check your figure.
What do you observe?
		
The point where the circle intersects the line l is the required
point B.

Playing with Constructions

Construct
1.

Construct a bigger house in which all the sides are of length 7 cm.

2.

Try to recreate ‘A Person’, ‘Wavy Wave’, and ‘Eyes’ from the section
‘Artworkʼ, using ideas involved in the ‘House’ construction.

3.

Is there a 4-sided figure in which all the sides are equal in length
but is not a square? If such a figure exists, can you construct it?

Hints
A) Eyes (from 8.1 Artwork and Construct above (page no. 215).
Part of the construction is shown earlier. Observe it carefully. You will
see two horizontal lines drawn lightly. In geometric constructions, one
often constructs supporting curves or figures that are not part of the given
figure but help in constructing it.
A

B

The technique to draw the upper and the lower curves of the eye is the
same as that used in the figure, ‘A Personʼ. Points A and B are the locations
where the tip of the compass is placed when drawing the curves of the
eye. Note that the upper curve and the lower curve should together form
a symmetrical figure. For this to happen, where should these points A and
B be placed? Make a good estimate.

Try to get the eyes as symmetrical and identical as possible. This might
need many trials.

B)		 (From Construct above (page no. 211).
 or the purpose of construction, let us take the side lengths to be of 5 cm.
F
Consider this figure.

A

5 cm

C

We need to identify only one more point to make this a 4-sided
figure. That point, let us call it D, should be 5 cm from both B and C.
How can such a point be found?
Can any of the ideas used in the ‘House’ problem be used here?

Summary
 All the points of a circle are at the same distance from its centre. This
distance is called the radius of the circle.
 A compass can be used to construct circles and their parts.
 A rough diagram can be useful in planning how to construct a given
figure.
 A rectangle can be constructed given the lengths of its sides or that of
one of its sides and a diagonal.
