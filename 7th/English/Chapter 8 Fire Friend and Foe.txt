Two friends share their feelings about brave soldiers.
One of them shares her experience of visiting the
National War Memorial that has left a deep impact
on her. They exchange letters and share their feelings
of gratitude for the freedom they enjoy because of
the sacrifices made by the bravehearts of the country.
The memorial symbolises the patriotism of the Indian

A HOMAGE TO OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS/115

for many centuries. Post-independence our
country has had to fight several wars to protect
its borders, territorial integrity, and its people.
This made me wonder, who were these brave _____________

territorial
Indian people? They fought to protect our country integrity:

and sacrificed their lives so that we could lead safeguarding
nation’s

our lives in peace. What were their names? Where borders

did they come from? Does anyone remember
anything about them? ________________

Last week I got the answers to some of my ________________

questions during an educational trip to New Delhi ________________

organised by our school. You may recall, I was ________________

________________
looking forward to this trip and our visit to many

________________
places of historical and educational significance.

________________
I learnt several new and interesting things, and I

________________
am excited to share them with you. ________________

Let me begin by asking you to guess the name
of the monument that I found most inspiring. Lets envisioned:

visualised
see if you can guess? The construction of this

________________
monument started in April 2018 and was

________________
completed in February 2019. It was envisioned
and then inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister iconic:

celebrated
Shri Narendra Modi in February 2019. In terms
of location and size, it is spread over 40 acres of
land near the iconic India Gate. But more
importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest tribute:

showing
Indians. I’m sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National respect,

gratitude
War Memorial’. Won’t you say, a long desired
aspiration was fullfilled?

Our visit to the National War Memorial began
with our teacher explaining that even after

________________ independence, India has had to fight many wars
________________ to protect itself, and the freedom and security we
________________ enjoy today is because of the many brave men
________________ and women who have served in the Indian Armed
________________ Forces over decades. Sadly, she said, war always
________________ takes its toll, and therefore, many brave soldiers
________________

have had to sacrifice their lives for the country
________________

even after our independence in 1947. This is what
________________

makes monuments like the National War
________________

Memorial extremely important so that we should
________________

never forget the cost of freedom. We are aware,
________________

________________ always, of the pain and horrors of war. We learnt

________________ that each brick of the memorial is called a tablet,

________________ and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for
India and made the supreme sacrifice in different

etched: wars from 1947 till date, including the Indo-China
engraved

________________ conflict of 1962, the Indo-Pak Wars in 1965 &

________________ 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There are
________________ 29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names
________________ of fallen soldiers have been etched.
gallantry: It was heartening to know that our government
exceptional
courage has recognised the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our
especially teacher told us about the 21 bravehearts who
in battle
—————– were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India’s
—————– highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service
—————– to the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir
—————– Chakra (MVC), Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC)

and Shaurya Chakra (SC).

Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously

in 1947. Later some more PVCs were awarded for
exceptional gallantry during the India-China

posthumously:

CITATION

________________  Lance Naik Albert Ekka,
________________ (No. 4239746), 14 Guards
________________

Lance Naik Albert Ekka was in the left forward
________________

company of a Battalion of the Brigade of Guards
________________

during their attack on the enemy defence at
________________

________________ Gangasagar on the eastern front. This was a

________________ well-fortified position held in strength by the

________________ enemy. The assaulting troops were subjected
________________ to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire,
________________ but they charged on to the objective and were
________________ locked in bitter hand-to-hand combat. Lance
________________ Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light
________________ Machine Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his
________________ company. With complete disregard to his
________________ personal safety, he charged the enemy bunker,
________________ bayoneted two enemy soldiers and silenced the
________________

Light Machine Gun. Though seriously wounded
________________

in this encounter, he continued to fight
________________

________________ alongside his comrades through the mile deep

________________ objective, clearing bunker after bunker with

________________ undaunted courage. Towards the northern end
________________ of the objective, one enemy Medium Machine
—————– Gun opened up from the second storey of a
—————– well-fortified building inflicting heavy casualties
—————– and holding up the attack. Once again, this
—————– gallant soldier without worrying about his

the heavy volume of enemy fire, crawled forward

till he reached the building and lobbed a grenade
through the loophole of the bunker, killing one
enemy and injuring the other. The Medium
Machine Gun, however, continued to fire. With ________________

outstanding courage and grim determination, ________________

Lance Naik Albert Ekka scaled a side wall and ________________

entering the bunker, bayoneted the enemy who ________________

was still firing and thus silenced the Machine ________________

Gun, saving further casualties to his company ________________

and ensured the success of the attack. In this ________________

process, however, he received serious injuries ________________

and succumbed to them after the capture of the ________________

objective. In this action, Lance Naik Albert Ekka ________________

________________
displayed the most conspicuous valour,

________________
determination and made the supreme sacrifice

________________
in the best traditions of the Army. (Gazette of

A HOMAGE TO OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS/121

Our teacher also explained the significance of
the Chakras to us. I found it interesting and hence
sharing with you.

The National War Memorial consists of 4
________________

concentric circles which are known as Amar ________________
Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra and Raksha ________________
Chakra around a 15-meter-tall central obelisk ________________
with the eternal flame— the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It ________________
also houses bronze and stone murals and graphic ________________
panels. Isn’t it amazing! ________________

The innermost circle represents the Amar ________________

Chakra, also known as the ‘Circle of Immortality’. ________________

This has the Obelisk with Eternal Flame. The ________________

Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the ________________

immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the ________________

assurance that the nation will never forget their ________________

sacrifice. ________________

The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra ________________

which is also known as the ‘Circle of Bravery’. mural: a
large picture

There is a covered gallery that exhibits six murals
on a wall

crafted in bronze depicting valiant battle actions ________________

of our Armed Forces. ________________

The third circle represents the Tyag Chakra, ________________

also known as the ‘Circle of Sacrifice’. The circular ________________

concentric walls of honour symbolise the ancient ________________

war formation which is called Chakravyuh. The ________________

walls are covered with granite tablets and ________________

individual tablet is solely dedicated to each fallen —————–

hero of post-Independent India. Their names are —————–

etched in golden letters.
The outermost circle represents the Raksha

Chakra, which is also known as the ‘Circle of

reassurance to the citizens of the country about

my eyes. It was sad to think about the massive
devastation and loss of life caused by wars. It
motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices
of our heroes.

Memorial. We divided ourselves into five groups.

We are choosing martyrs to make presentations

during the school assembly. I am delighted that ________________
all the students of our school will get to know ________________
about the National War Memorial and the soldiers ________________

On 28 June 1999, Major Padmapani Acharya

________________ which was heavily fortified, strongly held and
________________ covered with mines and sweeping machine gun

________________ With utter disregard to his personal safety,

Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the
enemy’s position, Major Padmapani Acharya
crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed
grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya

________________
was severely injured. Despite being seriously

________________
injured and unable to move, he ordered his men

________________
to leave him and charge at the enemy while he

________________
continued to fire at the enemy. The enemy

________________
position was finally over-run and the objective

________________
was captured.

________________
After completion of the mission, the officer

________________
however, succumbed to his injuries.

________________
Major Padmapani Acharya displayed

________________
exceptional courage, leadership and spirit of ________________
self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy. ________________

________________

Before he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his ________________

father that he wasn’t afraid or scared about losing ________________

his life while trying to protect the motherland. ________________

Quoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, he went on to say: ________________

Dear Soumya, ________________

________________

It was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I ________________

________________
enjoyed reading your experience of the visit to the

________________
National War Memorial in Delhi, as well as your

________________
observations and feelings during the visit. You

________________

________________
the essence of the emotions associated with this ________________

Memorial. ________________

I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity ________________

to visit the National War Memorial. I have heard a ________________

lot about it. Some people might see a war ________________

memorial as just a  monument, statue, an edifice ________________

to celebrate a war or victory and commemorate ________________

those who were martyred or injured in war. In my ________________

________________
view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for

________________
the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers

________________
defending the sovereignty and integrity of the

________________
country. I feel motivated and I am seriously

—————–
thinking of joining the Armed Forces for serving valiant:

my motherland. very brave

I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit ————–

such places to honour our valiant soldiers, who

have made great sacrifices for us. Their sacrifices
enable us to walk freely in our country without

________________ fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher
________________ and school to arrange this visit to give you all a
________________

chance to learn about India’s heroes and also
________________

pay your respect to them. The idea of your class
________________

to make a presentation at the school and making
________________

every one a part of your experience is wonderful!
________________

Best of luck for your presentation, I hope it goes
________________

well and motivates the school students to join
________________

________________ the Indian Armed Forces.

________________ Your letter has reminded me of a time when
________________ we visited the war memorial in our city. If I
________________________________ remember correctly, the day was National Martyrs
________________________________ Day. While visiting one of Chandigarh’s gardens
________________________________ we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea
________________________________ Garden in Sector 3. As we approached the garden,
________________________________ we saw people offering flowers and prayers. We
________________________________ joined the group out of curiosity and quickly
________________________________ realised that they were all there to pay respect to
________________________________

the soldiers at the War Memorial.
________________________________

When I think back about my visit where
________________________________

everyone was dedicating flowers as a mark of
________________________________

respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of the
________________________________

following poem:

A HOMAGE TO OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS/137

Meadow Surprises
Walk across a green field, a park or even under a clump
of trees, and you will notice many wonderful things.
What are some of the surprises a meadow has for
someone with a keen eye and a sharp ear?

Meadows have surprises,
You can find them if you look;
Walk softly through the velvet grass,
And listen by the brook.

You may see a butterfly
Rest upon a buttercup
And unfold its drinking straws
To sip the nectar up.

You may scare a rabbit
Who is sitting very still;
Though at first you may not see him,
When he hops you will.

A dandelion whose fuzzy head
Was golden days ago
Has turned to airy parachutes
That flutter when you blow.

Explore the meadow houses,
The burrows in the ground,
A nest beneath tall grasses,
The ant’s amazing mound.

Oh! Meadows have surprises
And many things to tell;
You may discover these yourself,
If you look and listen well.

A HOMAGE TO OUMR EBARDAOVWE  SSUORLPDRIIESRES/139

Read the following poem about the world of nature, which  is
as busy as the world of human beings.

Busy World

Bees are buzzing, frogs are hopping,
Moles are digging.  There’s no stopping

Vines from climbing, grass from growing,
Birds from singing, winds from blowing,

Buds from blooming. Bees are humming,
Sunbeams dancing, raindrops drumming.

All the world is whirling, dizzy,
Summertime is very busy!

FRANCES GORMAN RISSER

Delivery Delayed
Answer

The postman started moving
round the tree in circles. The dog
followed him, but as he did so, his
leash got wrapped around the tree.
The postman then safely walked
up to the front door.
