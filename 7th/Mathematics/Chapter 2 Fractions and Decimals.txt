2.1  MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS

You know how to find the area of a rectangle. It is equal to length × breadth. If the length
and breadth of a rectangle are 7 cm and 4 cm respectively, then what will be its area? Its
area would be 7 × 4 = 28 cm2.

What will be the area of the rectangle if its length and breadth are 7  cm and

2

1 1 1 15 7 15
3  cm respectively? You will say it will be 7  × 3  =  ×  cm2. The numbers

Thus, to multiply a whole number with a proper or an improper fraction, we

multiply the whole number with the numerator of the fraction, keeping the
denominator same.

1 1
So, we say  of 2 is 1. We can also get it as  × 2 = 1.

2 2

1 1
Thus,  of 2 =  × 2 = 1

There are six such equal parts. ‘A’ is one of these parts.

1 1 1 1
So, ‘A’ is  of the whole. Thus,   ×   =  .

she pay? Certainly it would be ̀  (8.50 × 1.50). Both 8.5 and 1.5 are decimal numbers.
So, we have come across a situation where we need to know how to multiply two deci-
mals. Let us now learn the multiplication of two decimal numbers.

First we find 0.1 × 0.1.

1 1 1
Now, 0.1 = . So, 0.1 × 0.1 = ×  =

10 10 10

1×1 1
 =  = 0.01.

10 ×10 100

Let us see it’s pictorial representation (Fig 2.13)

The shaded part in the picture represents .

We know that,

1 1 1 1 1
×  means  of . So, divide this th part into 10 equal parts and take one

10 10 10 10 10
part out of it.

Thus, we have, (Fig 2.14).

        

Fig 2.14

The dotted square is one part out of 10 of the th part. That is, it represents

10

1 1
×  or  0.1 × 0.1.

10 10

Can the dotted square be represented in some other way?

How many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14?

There are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01.

Hence, 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01.

Note that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is
one digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two
digits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point.

Let us now find 0.2 × 0.3.

2 3
We have, 0.2 × 0.3 = ×

10 10

1 1
As we did for × , let us divide the square into 10 equal

parts and take three parts out of it, to get . Again divide each

of these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get × .

10 10
2 3

The dotted squares represent ×  or 0.2 × 0.3. (Fig 2.15)
10 10

Since there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06.

Thus, 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.06.

Observe that 2 × 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06

is 2 (= 1 + 1).

Check whether this applies to 0.1 × 0.1 also.

Find 0.2 × 0.4 by applying these observations.

While finding 0.1 × 0.1 and 0.2 × 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied

them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 × 0.1, we found 01 × 01 or 1 ×

1. Similarly in 0.2 × 0.3 we found 02 × 03 or 2 × 3.

Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved

towards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is

obtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal

numbers that are being multiplied.

Let us now find 1.2 × 2.5.

Multiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is 1 digit to the right of the

decimal point. So, count 1 + 1 = 2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move

towards left. We get 3.00 or 3.

Find in a similar way 1.5 × 1.6, 2.4 × 4.2.

While multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the

decimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2 = 3 (Why?) digits starting from the

rightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 × 1.25 = 3.225

Find 2.7 × 1.35.

TRY THESE

   1. Find: (i) 2.7 × 4 (ii) 1.8 × 1.2 (iii) 2.3 × 4.35

   2. Arrange the products obtained in (1) in descending order.

EXAMPLE 3 The side of an equilateral triangle is 3.5 cm. Find its perimeter.

SOLUTION All the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.

2024-25



FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 37

So, length of each side = 3.5 cm

Thus, perimeter = 3 × 3.5 cm = 10.5 cm

EXAMPLE 4 The length of a rectangle is 7.1 cm and its breadth is 2.5 cm.

What is the area of the rectangle?

SOLUTION Length of the rectangle = 7.1 cm

Breadth of the rectangle = 2.5 cm

Therefore, area of the rectangle = 7.1 × 2.5 cm2 = 17.75 cm2

2.3.1 Multiplication of Decimal Numbers by 10, 100 and 1000

23 235
Reshma observed that 2.3 =  whereas 2.35 = . Thus, she found that depending

10 100
on the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with
denominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen if a decimal number is multiplied
by 10 or 100 or 1000.

Let us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000.

Have a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks:

176
1.76 × 10  = × 10 = 17.6 2.35 ×10 =___ 12.356 × 10 =___

100

176
1.76 × 100 = × 100 = 176 or 176.0 2.35 ×100 = ___ 12.356 × 100 =___

100

176
1.76 × 1000 =  × 1000 = 1760   or 2.35 ×1000 = ___ 12.356 × 1000 = ___

100

                                                1760.0

0.5 × 10 =  × 10 = 5     ;     0.5 × 100 = ___     ;     0.5 × 1000 = ___

10

Observe the shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are
multiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 × 10 = 17.6, the digits are same i.e., 1, 7 and 6. Do
you observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the
decimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place.
Note that 10 has one zero over 1.

In 1.76×100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many
digits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two
places.

Note that 100 has two zeros over one.

Do you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also?

2024-25



38 MATHEMATICS

So we say, when a decimal number is multiplied by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits in
the product are same as in the decimal number but the decimal point in the product
is shifted to the right by as, many of places as there are zeros over one.

Based on these observations we can now say

2.4  DIVISION OF DECIMAL NUMBERS

Savita was preparing a design to decorate her classroom. She needed a few coloured
strips of paper of length 1.9 cm each. She had a strip of coloured paper of length 9.5 cm.
How many pieces of the required length will she get out of this strip? She thought it would

9.5
be cm. Is she correct?

1.9
Both 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of

decimal numbers too!

2.4.1  Division by 10, 100 and 1000

Let us find the division of a decimal number by 10, 100 and 1000.
Consider  31.5 ÷ 10.

2024-25



FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 39

315 1 315
31.5 ÷ 10 = ×  =  = 3.15

10 10 100

315 1 315
Similarly, 31.5 ÷100 = ×  = = 0.315

10 100 1000
Let us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000. This may

help us in dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000 in a shorter way.

31.5 ÷ 10 = 3.15 231.5 ÷ 10 =___ 1.5 ÷ 10 =___ 29.36 ÷ 10 =___

31.5 ÷ 100 = 0.315 231.5 ÷ 10 =___ 1.5 ÷ 100 =___ 29.36 ÷ 100 =___

31.5 ÷ 1000 = 0.0315 231.5 ÷ 1000 =___ 1.5 ÷ 1000 =___ 29.36 ÷ 1000 =___

Take 31.5 ÷ 10 = 3.15. In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are
same i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the TRY THESE

quotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal
Find: (i) 235.4 ÷ 10

point has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one
zero over 1.   (ii) 235.4 ÷100

Consider now 31.5 ÷ 100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the  (iii) 235.4 ÷ 1000
digits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient?
It has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two
zeros over1.

So we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the
number and the quotient are same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the
left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Using this observation let us now
quickly find:        2.38 ÷ 10 = 0.238,  2.38 ÷ 100 = 0.0238, 2.38 ÷ 1000 = 0.00238

2.4.2  Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number

6.4 TRY THESE
Let us find . Remember we also write it as 6.4 ÷ 2.

2 (i) 35.7 ÷ 3 = ?;

64 64 1 (ii) 25.5 ÷ 3 = ?
So, 6.4 ÷ 2 =  ÷ 2  = ×  as learnt in fractions..

= = = ×  = × 32 = = 3.2

10 × 2 10 × 2 10 2 10 10

Or, let us first divide 64 by 2. We get 32. There is one digit to the right of the decimal
point in 6.4. Place the decimal in 32 such that there would be one digit to its
right. We get 3.2 again.

TRY THESE
To find 19.5 ÷ 5, first find 195 ÷5. We get 39. There is one digit to the

right of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there (i) 43.15 ÷ 5 = ?;

would be one digit to its right. You will get 3.9. (ii) 82.44 ÷ 6 = ?

(ii) 126.35 ÷ 7 Or, divide 1296 by 4. You get 324. There are two digits to the right of
the decimal in 12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you

will get 3.24.

Note that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in
which, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number
to give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 ÷ 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves
remainder zero.

However, there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by
another number, i.e., we may not get remainder zero. For example, 195 ÷ 7. We deal with
such situations in later classes.

25.5
What do you observe? For , we find that there is one digit to the right of the

0.5
decimal in 0.5. This could be converted to whole number by dividing by 10. Accordingly
25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10.

Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5.
So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255.

Length of each side = 2.5 cm. Thus, the number of sides =  =  = 5

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?

their numerators and denominators seperately and writing the product as
product of numerators 2 5 2 × 5 10

.  For example, × = = .
product of denominators 3 7 3× 7 21

2. A fraction acts as an operator ‘of ’. For example,  of  2 is  × 2 = 1.

3. (a) The product of two proper fractions is less than each of the fractions that are

multiplied.

(b) The product of a proper and an improper fraction is less than the improper
fraction and greater than the proper fraction.

(c) The product of two imporper fractions is greater than the two fractions.

4. A reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting it upside down.
5. We have seen how to divide two fractions.

(a) While dividing a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number
with the reciprocal of that fraction.

3 5 10
For example, 2 ÷ = 2 × =

5 3 3
(b) While dividing a fraction by a whole number we multiply the fraction by the

reciprocal of the whole number.

For example, ÷ 7 = × =

(c) While dividing one fraction by another fraction, we multuiply the first fraction by

2 5 2 7 14
the reciprocal of the other. So, ÷ = × = .

3 7 3 5 15
6. We also learnt how to multiply two decimal numbers. While multiplying two decimal

numbers, first multiply them as whole numbers. Count the number of digits to the right
of the decimal point in both the decimal numbers. Add the number of digits counted.
Put the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place.
The count should be the sum obtained earlier.

For example, 0.5 × 0.7 = 0.35

FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 43

7. To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the
number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1.
Thus  0.53 × 10 = 5.3,     0.53 × 100 = 53,      0.53 × 1000 = 530

8. We have seen how to divide decimal numbers.
(a) To divide a decimal number by a whole number, we first divide them as whole

numbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number.

For example, 8.4 ÷ 4 = 2.1

Note that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero.
(b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal

number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the
quotient.

So, 23.9 ÷ 10 = 2.39,23.9 ÷ 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 ÷ 1000 = 0.0239
(c) While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by

equal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number. Then
divide. Thus, 2.4 ÷ 0.2 = 24 ÷ 2 = 12.
