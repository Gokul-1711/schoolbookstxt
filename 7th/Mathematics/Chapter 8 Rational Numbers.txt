Rational
Numbers

8.1  INTRODUCTION

You began your study of numbers by counting objects around you. The
numbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or natural
numbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, ... By including 0 to natural numbers, we
got the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The negatives of natural
numbers were then put together with whole numbers to make up
integers. Integers are ..., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... We, thus, extended
the number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from
whole numbers to integers.

numerator
You were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form ,

denominator
where the numerator is either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator, a positive integer.
You compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them.

In this Chapter, we shall extend  the number system further. We shall introduce the concept
of rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.

8.2  NEED FOR RATIONAL NUMBERS

Earlier, we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving
numbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then
the distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by –5. If a profit of ̀  150
was represented by 150 then a loss of ̀  100 could be written as –100.

There are many situations similar to the above situations that involve fractional numbers.

You can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as  km. Can we represent 750m

RATIONAL NUMBERS 125

8.3  WHAT ARE RATIONAL NUMBERS?
The word ‘rational’ arises from the term ‘ratio’. You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be

3
written as . Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.

2
Similarly, the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form

p
. This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.

q
A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed in the

p
form , where p and q are integers and q ≠  0.

q

4
Thus,  is a rational number. Here, p = 4 and q = 5.

5
−3

Is  also a rational number? Yes, because p = – 3 and q = 4 are integers.

3 4 2
l You have seen many fractions like , ,1  etc. All fractions are rational

8 8 3
numbers. Can you say why?
How about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be

5
written as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = ,

10
333

0.333 =  etc.

Numerator and Denominator
p

In , the integer p is the numerator, and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator.
q

−3
Thus, in , the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.

7
Mention five rational numbers each of whose
(a) Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer.
(b) Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer.
(c) Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.
(d) Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.

l Are integers also rational numbers?
Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer –5 is a

−5
rational number, because you can write it as . The integer 0 can also be written as

1
0 0

0 = or  etc. Hence, it is also a rational number.
2 7

Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.

Equivalent rational numbers

A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example,

– 2
consider the rational number .

3

– 2 –2 × 2 – 4 – 2 – 4
 = = . We see that  is the same as .

3 3 × 2 6 3 6

–2 (–2) × (–5) 10 – 2 10
Also,  =

Thus,  =  =

be equivalent to each other.

obtaining equivalent fractions.

8.5  RATIONAL NUMBERS ON A NUMBER LINE

You know how to represent integers on a number line. Let us draw one such number line.

The points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points
to the left of 0 are denoted by – sign and are negative integers.

Representation of fractions on a number line is also known to you.

Let us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line.
1

Let us represent the number −  on the number line.
2

As done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked
on the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0.

1
To which side of 0 will you mark − ? Being a negative rational number, it would be

2
marked to the left of 0.

You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are
marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and –1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2
and –2, 3 and –3.

2024-25



128 MATHEMATICS

1 1
In the same way, the rational numbers  and −  would be at equal distance from 0.

2 2
1

We know how to mark the rational number . It is marked at a point which is half the
2

1
distance between 0 and 1. So, −  would be marked at a point half the distance between

2
0 and –1.

3
We know how to mark  on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies

2
−3

halfway between 1 and 2. Let us now mark  on the number line. It lies on the left of 0
2

3
and is at the same distance as  from 0.

2
−1 −2 = − −3 −4

In decreasing order, we have, , ( 1) , , (= −2) . This shows that
2 2 2 2

−3 −3

1 1

Similarly, −  is to the left of zero and at the same distance from zero as  is to the
3 3

1
right. So as done above, −  can be represented on the number line. Once we know how

3
1 2 4 5

to represent −  on the number line, we can go on representing − , − , −  and so on.
3 3 3 3

All other rational numbers with different denominators can be represented in a similar way.

8.6  RATIONAL NUMBERS IN STANDARD FORM

3 −5 2 − 7
Observe the rational numbers , , , .

5 8 7 11

The denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and 1 is
the only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further,
the negative sign occurs only in the numerator.

Such rational numbers are said to be in standard form.
2024-25



RATIONAL NUMBERS 129

A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a
positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other
than 1.

If a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the
standard form.

Recall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and
the denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer. We shall use the
same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form.

−45
EXAMPLE 1 Reduce  to the standard form.

30

−45 −45 ÷ 3 −15 −15 ÷ 5 −3
SOLUTION We have,  = = = =

30 30 ÷ 3 10 10 ÷ 5 2
We had to divide twice. First time by 3 and then by 5. This could also be done as

−45 −45 ÷15 −3
= =

30 30 ÷15 2
In this example, note that 15 is the HCF of 45 and 30.

Thus, to reduce the rational number to its standard form, we divide its numerator
and denominator by their HCF ignoring the negative sign, if any. (The reason for
ignoring the negative sign will be studied in Higher Classes)

If there is negative sign in the denominator, divide by ‘– HCF’.

EXAMPLE 2 Reduce to standard form:

36 −3
(i) − (ii)

24 −15

SOLUTION

(i) The HCF of 36 and 24 is 12.

Thus, its standard form would be obtained by dividing by –12.

36 36 ÷ (−12) −3
= ( =

−24 −24 ÷ −12) 2

(ii) The HCF of 3 and 15 is 3.

−3 −3 ÷ (−2) 1
Thus, = =

8.7  COMPARISON OF RATIONAL NUMBERS

We know how to compare two integers or two fractions and tell which is smaller or which
is greater among them. Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers.

2 5
l Two positive rational numbers, like and  can be compared as studied earlier in the

3 7
case of fractions.

1 1
l Mary compared two negative rational numbers −  and −  using number line. She

2 5
knew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer, was the greater
integer.

For example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 > 2. The integer – 2 is on
the right of – 5 on the number line and  – 2 > – 5.

She used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers

1 1
on the number line. She marked −  and −  as follows:

2 5

–1 0 1

−1 −5 −1 −2
= =

2 10 5 10
1 5

Has she correctly marked the two points? How and why did she convert −  to −
2 10

1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1
and −  to − ? She found that −  is to the right of − . Thus, − > −  or − <− .

5 10 5 2 5 2 2 5

3 2 1 1
Can you compare −  and − ? −  and − ?

4 3 3 5

1 1 1
We know from our study of fractions that < . And what did Mary get for −  and

5 2 2
1

− ? Was it not exactly the opposite?
5

1 1 1 1
You will find that, >  but − < − .

2 5 2 5

3 2
Do you observe the same for −

1 1
, −  and − , − ?

4 3 3 5

Mary remembered that in integers she had studied  4 > 3
but – 4 < –3, 5 > 2 but –5 < –2 etc.

2024-25



RATIONAL NUMBERS 131

l The case of pairs of negative rational numbers is similar. To compare two negative
rational numbers, we compare them ignoring their negative signs and then reverse
the order.

7 5 7 5
For example, to compare −  and − , we first compare  and .

5 3 5 3

7 5 –7 –5
We get  <  and conclude that > .

5 3 5 3

Take five more such pairs and compare them.

3 2 4 3
Which is greater −  or − ?; −  or − ?

8 7 3 2

l Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious. A negative rational
number is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on
a number line. So, a negative rational number will always be less than a positive rational
number.

2 1
Thus, − < .

8.8 RATIONAL NUMBERS BETWEEN TWO RATIONAL NUMBERS

Reshma wanted to count the whole numbers between 3 and 10. From her earlier classes,
she knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly, she
wanted to know the total number of integers between –3 and 3. The integers between –3
and 3 are –2, –1, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between –3 and 3.

Are there any integers between –3 and –2? No, there is no integer between
–3 and –2. Between two successive integers the number of integers is 0.

2024-25



132 MATHEMATICS

Thus, we find that number of integers between two integers are limited (finite).

Will the same happen in the case of rational numbers also?

By using this method, you can insert as many rational numbers as you want between
two different rational numbers.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?

p
1. A number that can be expressed in the form q , where p and q are integers and

−2 3
q ≠  0, is called a rational number. The numbers , ,3 etc. are rational numbers.

2. All integers and fractions are rational numbers.

3. If the numerator and denominator of a rational number are multiplied or divided by a
non-zero integer, we get a rational number which is said to be equivalent to the given

−3 2
rational number. For example = −3 × = −6 − 6

. So, we say  is the equivalent

4. Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. When the
numerator and denominator, both, are positive integers, it is a positive rational number.
When either the numerator or the denominator is a negative integer, it is a negative

3 −8
rational number. For example,  is a positive rational number whereas  is a

8 9
negative rational number.

5. The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number.

6. A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive
integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1.

−1 2
The numbers ,  etc. are in standard form.

3 7

7. There are unlimited number of rational numbers between two rational numbers.

8. Two rational numbers with the same denominator can be added by adding their
numerators, keeping the denominator same. Two rational numbers with different
denominators are added by first taking the LCM of the two denominators and
then converting both the rational numbers to their equivalent forms having the

−2
LCM as the denominator. For ex + 3 = −16 + 9 = −16+9 = −7

ample, . Here,
3 8 24 24 24 24

LCM of 3 and 8 is 24.

9. While subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational
number to be subtracted to the other rational number.

7 2 7 2 7 + (−2) = 21+ (−16) = 5
Thus, − = +additive inverse of = .
